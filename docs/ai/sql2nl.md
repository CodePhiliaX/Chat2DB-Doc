## Feature 2: SQL Translation to Natural Language

Sometimes, we encounter highly complex SQL queries, some of which may be hundreds or even thousands of lines long. Understanding the meaning of such SQL can take hours or even days. With Chat2DB, we can quickly comprehend the purpose of such SQL queries. 

```sql
## ---BEGIN---
## SELECT score.score 
FROM score 
INNER JOIN student_course ON score.course_id = student_course.course_id 
INNER JOIN student ON student_course.student_id = student.id 
WHERE student.name = 'Xiao Ming'
## ---SQL Explanation:---
The purpose of this SQL query is to select the "score" column from the "score" table. It uses "INNER JOIN" to connect the "score" table with the "student_course" table and the "student" table. The conditions for joining are that the "course_id" column in the "score" table matches the "course_id" column in the "student_course" table, and the "student_id" column in the "student_course" table matches the "id" column in the "student" table. Finally, the "WHERE" clause filters records from the "student" table where the "name" column is 'Xiao Ming'. The purpose of this query is to find the scores of the student 'Xiao Ming' in all courses.
