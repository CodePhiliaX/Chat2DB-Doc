## Feature 3: SQL Optimization

Sometimes, when we write a SQL query that doesn't perform well, Chat2DB can help us optimize the SQL to improve query performance.

```sql
## ---BEGIN---
## SELECT score.score 
FROM score 
INNER JOIN student_course ON score.course_id = student_course.course_id 
INNER JOIN student ON student_course.student_id = student.id 
WHERE student.name = 'Xiao Ming'
## ---SQL Optimization:---
Optimization Suggestions:

1. Index Optimization: Create an index on the 'name' column of the 'student' table to speed up the query in the WHERE clause.

2. JOIN Optimization: Consider using a subquery or temporary table to filter records with the name 'Xiao Ming' from the 'student' table before performing the JOIN operation. This can reduce the amount of data involved in the JOIN operation and improve query efficiency.

3. Database Design Optimization: Consider merging the 'student' table and 'student_course' table into a single table to avoid JOIN operations and improve query efficiency.

4. Cache Optimization: Consider caching query results to avoid redundant queries and improve query efficiency.
