```plaintext
"Show me the total sales for the last quarter grouped by product category."
```

Chat2DB will automatically convert this into SQL:

```sql
SELECT product_category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31'
GROUP BY product_category;
```

This feature significantly reduces the time spent on manual coding and improves data management efficiency.

### 2. [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/research/codex)

OpenAI Codex is renowned for its ability to translate natural language into SQL with high accuracy. Developers can input queries in plain English, and Codex will generate the corresponding SQL commands. For instance:

Input:

```plaintext
"List the top 10 customers by purchase amount."
```

Output:

```sql
SELECT customer_name, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customer_purchases
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
