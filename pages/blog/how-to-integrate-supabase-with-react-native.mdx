| 6. Environment Variables | Keep your API keys secure by creating a `.env` file in your project root. Add your Supabase URL and API key: `SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url` `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key` |
| 7. Using Chat2DB | For managing your Supabase database, consider utilizing [Chat2DB](https://chat2db.ai). It simplifies database operations and helps visualize data structures and queries effortlessly. |

## Integrating Supabase with React Native

Now that your development environment is ready, let’s dive into integrating Supabase into your React Native app with the following steps and code snippets.

### Installing and Initializing Supabase Client

To initialize the Supabase client, create a new file named `supabaseClient.js` in your project and add the following code:

```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

### Implementing Authentication Features

Supabase offers various authentication methods. Below is an example of implementing email/password authentication:

1. **Sign Up Functionality**:
```javascript
const signUp = async (email, password) => {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
  });

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error signing up: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('User signed up: ', user);
  }
};
```

2. **Login Functionality**:
```javascript
const login = async (email, password) => {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    email,
    password,
  });

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error logging in: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('User logged in: ', user);
  }
};
```

3. **Password Recovery**:
```javascript
const recoverPassword = async (email) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.api.resetPasswordForEmail(email);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error sending recovery email: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Recovery email sent: ', data);
  }
};
```

### Real-Time Database Capabilities

Supabase’s real-time capabilities can be leveraged to sync data in your application. Below is an example of subscribing to changes in a table:

```javascript
const subscribeToTable = () => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .from('your_table_name')
    .on('INSERT', payload => {
      console.log('New row added: ', payload);
    })
    .subscribe();

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
};
```

### CRUD Operations

Supabase simplifies CRUD operations. Here's how to implement them in your React Native app:

1. **Create**:
```javascript
const createRow = async (data) => {
  const { data: newData, error } = await supabase
    .from('your_table_name')
    .insert([data]);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error creating row: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Row created: ', newData);
  }
};
```

2. **Read**:
```javascript
const readRows = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('your_table_name')
    .select('*');

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error reading rows: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Rows read: ', data);
  }
};
```

3. **Update**:
```javascript
const updateRow = async (id, newData) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('your_table_name')
    .update(newData)
    .eq('id', id);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error updating row: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Row updated: ', data);
  }
};
```

4. **Delete**:
```javascript
const deleteRow = async (id) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('your_table_name')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', id);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting row: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Row deleted: ', data);
  }
};
```

Incorporating error handling is crucial for a smooth user experience. Use try-catch blocks or check for errors in each operation to provide appropriate notifications to users.

## Implementing Authentication

Supabase supports multiple methods for user authentication. Below are examples of setting up authentication flows in your React Native app.

### Email/Password Authentication

To implement email/password authentication, refer to the previous sections for the sign-up and login functions.

### Third-Party Providers

Supabase allows third-party authentication through providers like Google and GitHub. Here’s how to implement Google authentication:

```javascript
const signInWithGoogle = async () => {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'google',
  });

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error signing in with Google: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('User logged in with Google: ', user);
  }
};
```

### Managing User Sessions

Utilize the following code to check user authentication status:

```javascript
const user = supabase.auth.user();

if (user) {
  console.log('User is logged in: ', user);
} else {
  console.log('No user is currently logged in.');
}
```

### Password Reset and Email Verification

For password resets and email verification, use the built-in functions provided by Supabase.

### Monitoring User Data with Chat2DB

While developing your application, consider using [Chat2DB](https://chat2db.ai) to monitor user data and authentication logs. Chat2DB's AI capabilities enable you to analyze user behavior and streamline database management.

## Working with Supabase Database

Effectively utilizing Supabase’s PostgreSQL database is crucial for your React Native application. Here are steps to manage your database and perform operations:

### Database Structure and Schema

A typical Supabase database consists of tables that define your application's data structure. Use the Supabase dashboard to create and manage your tables.

### Creating Tables

In the Supabase dashboard, create tables by defining their schemas. For example, you might create a `users` table with fields such as `id`, `email`, and `password`.

### Performing CRUD Operations in React Native

Utilize the previously defined CRUD functions to interact with your Supabase database from your React Native app.

### Data Subscriptions for Real-Time Updates

Subscribing to data changes is a powerful feature of Supabase, allowing your app to stay updated with the latest data without manual refreshes.

### Row Level Security (RLS)

To ensure data privacy and security, use Supabase’s Row Level Security (RLS). Define policies that control data access based on user roles and permissions.

### Visualizing Database Schemas with Chat2DB

Using [Chat2DB](https://chat2db.ai), you can effectively visualize and manage your database schemas. Its AI capabilities enhance your ability to analyze data and optimize queries.

## Utilizing Supabase Storage for Media Management

Supabase offers robust storage solutions for managing media files in your React Native application. Below are steps to integrate media management.

### Setting Up Storage Buckets

In the Supabase dashboard, create storage buckets to organize your media files.

### Uploading and Downloading Media Files

Here’s how to upload and download images using Supabase storage:

1. **Upload Media**:
```javascript
const uploadMedia = async (file) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from('your_bucket_name')
    .upload('path/to/file', file);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error uploading media: ', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Media uploaded: ', data);
  }
};
```

2. **Download Media**:
```javascript
const downloadMedia = async (path) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from('your_bucket_name')
    .download(path);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error downloading media: ', error);
  } else {
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(data);
    console.log('Media downloaded: ', url);
  }
};
```

### Securing Access to Storage Files

Utilize Supabase’s permissions settings to secure access to your storage files. Define who can view or edit files in your storage buckets.

## Enhancing Performance and Security

Optimizing performance and security in your Supabase-integrated React Native app is essential for a smooth user experience. Here are key considerations:

### Reducing API Calls

Minimize the number of API calls by caching results where possible. Use local storage to save frequently accessed data.
