# How to create a table with SQL code?

SQL is used not only for working with table data but also for managing all tasks related to databases and tables, including creating and modifying tables. There are two common ways to create a table:

1. **Using interactive tools**: Most database management systems (DBMS) come with interactive tools that let users create and manage database tables through a graphical user interface.
2. **Using SQL statements**: Tables can also be created and managed directly through SQL statements.

To create a table programmatically, you can use the SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement. Keep in mind that even when using an interactive tool, SQL statements are being executed in the background. The tool automatically generates and runs these statements for you, so there's no need to manually write them (this is also true when altering an existing table's structure).

The `CREATE TABLE` statement lets us define the structure of a table, such as its columns, data types, and constraints. In this article, we’ll go over how to use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to create a table, with real-world examples to demonstrate its usage.

## The Basic Syntax of the SQL CREATE TABLE Statement

The `CREATE TABLE` statement follows this basic syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype [constraint],
    column2 datatype [constraint],
    ...
);
```

- `table_name`: The name of the table you want to create.
- `column1`, `column2`, and so on: The names of the table's columns.
- `datatype`: The data type for each column, such as `INT` for integers, `VARCHAR` for variable-length strings, or `DATE` for date values.
- `constraint`: Optional constraints, like `NOT NULL` (to prevent null values), `PRIMARY KEY` (to define a primary key), or `FOREIGN KEY` (to enforce a foreign key relationship).

When creating a new table, the table name must not already exist; otherwise, it will result in an error. To avoid accidentally overwriting an existing table, SQL requires that the table be deleted manually before recreating it, rather than simply overwriting it with a `CREATE TABLE` command.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user;
```

## Data Types

When using the `CREATE TABLE` statement, it's necessary to assign a suitable data type to each column. Here are some common data types:

### Integer Types

- `INT`: A 4-byte integer that can store values between -2147483648 and 2147483647.
- `BIGINT`: An 8-byte large integer capable of storing a wider range of values.
- `SMALLINT`: A 2-byte small integer, typically storing values between -32768 and 32767.

### String Types

- `VARCHAR(n)`: A variable-length string, where `n` represents the maximum length. For instance, `VARCHAR(50)` can hold up to 50 characters.
- `CHAR(n)`: A fixed-length string type. If the string is shorter than the defined length `n`, it is padded with spaces.
- `TEXT`: Used for storing large amounts of text data.

### Date and Time Types

- `DATE`: Stores dates in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `TIME`: Stores times in the `HH:MM:SS` format.
- `DATETIME`: Stores both date and time in the `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format.

### Other Types

- `BOOLEAN`: Stores boolean values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
- `DECIMAL(p,s)`: Stores fixed-point numbers where `p` is the total number of digits and `s` is the number of decimal places. For example, `DECIMAL(10,2)` can hold up to 10 digits with 2 reserved for the decimal part.

## Constraints

Constraints help enforce data integrity and define specific rules for the data in a table. Here are some commonly used constraints:

### NOT NULL

A `NULL` value represents missing or undefined data. Columns that allow `NULL` values can have rows inserted without a value for that column. Conversely, a column defined as `NOT NULL` requires a value to be provided whenever a row is inserted or updated. Each column in a table is either defined as allowing `NULL` or as `NOT NULL`, based on the table's structure. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers(
    customer id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer name VARCHAR(50)NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In the previous example, the `customer_name` column is marked as `NOT NULL`, meaning a value is required when inserting data into the table.

If the `NOT NULL` constraint is not explicitly set, most DBMS will assume the column allows `NULL` values by default. However, this behavior is not consistent across all DBMS.

Furthermore, only columns that disallow `NULL` values can be used as a primary key. A column that permits `NULL` values cannot be a unique identifier, as `NULL` signifies missing or unknown data, which cannot ensure uniqueness.

### `PRIMARY KEY`

The primary key is used to ensure that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable. A table can have only one primary key, and the values in the primary key column must be unique with no duplicates. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders(
    order id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer id INT,
    order date DATE
);
```

In this case, the `order_id` column is set as the primary key, guaranteeing that every order has a unique identifier.

### `FOREIGN KEY`

Foreign keys are used to create a relationship between two tables. The values in the foreign key column must correspond to existing values in the primary key column of another table. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders(
    order id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer id INT,
    order date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY(customer id)REFERENCES customers(customer id)
);
```

In this case, the `customer_id` column in the `orders` table is a foreign key referencing the `customer_id` column in the `customers` table. This guarantees that every customer ID added to the `orders` table exists in the `customers` table.

### `UNIQUE`

This ensures that the values in the column are unique, though `NULL` values are allowed. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users(
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50)UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In this case, the `username` column is marked as unique, which means no two users can share the same username.

### `CHECK`

This is used to enforce that the values in a column meet specific conditions. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees(
    employee id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    age INT,
    CHECK(age >= 18)
);
```

In this case, the `age` column is constrained to be 18 or older, implemented through a check constraint.

## Setting Default Values

SQL enables you to set default values, so if no value is provided during row insertion, the DBMS automatically assigns the default. You can specify this using the `DEFAULT` keyword within the column definition in the `CREATE TABLE` statement. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INT default 1
);
```

This statement creates a `user` table with a `quantity` column representing the number of items per order. In this case, `DEFAULT 1` is added, indicating that the DBMS should assign a quantity of 1 if no value is provided. Default values are frequently used for date or timestamp fields.

For instance, by using functions or variables that reference the system date, the system date can be set as the default.

In MySQL, users can set `DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE()`, Oracle users use `DEFAULT SYSDATE`, and SQL Server users specify `DEFAULT GETDATE()`.

## Case study

Let’s say we need to create a table called `students` to store student information. The table will have the following structure:

| Column Name | Data Type                       | Constraints       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| id          | INT                             | PRIMARY KEY       |
| name        | VARCHAR(50)                     | NOT NULL          |
| age         | INT                             | CHECK (age >= 18) |
| gender      | ENUM('male', 'female', 'other') | NOT NULL          |
| major       | VARCHAR(50)                     |                   |

If we try to insert data that violates the constraints — such as entering a student with an age below 18 — the database will reject the operation and return an error message.

## Points to Note

### **1. Choosing the Right Data Type**

It’s important to choose data types that fit your needs, to avoid wasting storage or introducing inaccuracies. For instance, if a column only holds two possible values (like 0 and 1), use a `BOOLEAN` type rather than `INT`.

### **2. Setting Reasonable Constraints**

Constraints maintain data integrity and consistency, but using too many or overly strict constraints may slow down data inserts and updates. Define constraints based on real-world business requirements and the nature of the data.

### **3. Planning for Future Scalability**

When designing a table, consider future business changes to allow easy expansion of the table. You can reserve some extra columns or use flexible data types to accommodate growth.

### **4. Follow Naming Conventions**

Use meaningful names for tables and columns, and stick to a consistent naming convention to make the code more readable and maintainable. For example, you could use plural names for tables and nouns for columns.

## Conclusion

The SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement provides a simple way to create database tables. While doing so, it’s crucial to pick the right data types, define appropriate constraints, and think ahead about scalability and naming conventions. By working through real-world examples, we gain a deeper understanding of how to use `CREATE TABLE` to design tables that meet our actual needs. Mastering these concepts will improve our ability to manage and work with databases efficiently.
