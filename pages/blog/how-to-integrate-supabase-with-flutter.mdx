2. **Extract the SDK**: Unzip the downloaded file to a location on your machine.
3. **Update Path**: Add the Flutter `bin` directory to your system's PATH variable.
   - For Windows, search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu, and update the PATH variable.
   - For macOS and Linux, you can update the `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.

### Setting Up an IDE

You can use any IDE, but Android Studio and Visual Studio Code are the most recommended for Flutter development.

- **Android Studio**: Download it from the [Android Studio website](https://developer.android.com/studio) and install the Flutter and Dart plugins.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Install it from the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Install the Flutter and Dart extensions from the marketplace.

### Configuring Supabase CLI

To manage your backend, install the Supabase CLI:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. **Install Supabase CLI**: Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

Now you are ready to start creating your project!

## Creating a Supabase Project and Configuring Database

Creating a new project in Supabase is straightforward. Follow these steps to set up your database schema:

1. **Sign Up**: Go to the [Supabase website](https://supabase.io/) and sign up for a free account.
2. **Create a New Project**: Click on "New Project" and fill in the required details such as project name, password, and database region.
3. **Access the Dashboard**: Once your project is created, you will be redirected to the Supabase dashboard.

### Configuring Database Schema

1. **Create Tables**: Navigate to the "Table editor" section and create a new table. For example, let's create a `users` table:
   - **Table Name**: users
   - **Columns**:
     - id (integer, primary key, auto-increment)
     - email (text, unique)
     - password (text)
     - created_at (timestamp, default value: `now()`)

2. **Using SQL Editor**: Alternatively, you can use the SQL editor to run the following SQL command:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       email TEXT UNIQUE,
       password TEXT,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
   );
   ```

## Integrating Supabase with Flutter

Now that your Supabase project is set up, it's time to integrate it with your Flutter app.

### Adding Supabase Package

Add the Supabase Flutter package to your project by updating the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  supabase_flutter: ^0.2.9
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Initializing Supabase Client

Now you need to initialize the Supabase client in your Flutter application. Update the `main.dart` file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  await Supabase.initialize(
    url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
    anonKey: 'YOUR_ANON_KEY',
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and `YOUR_ANON_KEY` with your actual Supabase project credentials.

### Fetching Data from Supabase

To demonstrate fetching data, let’s create a simple screen that displays user data:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Supabase & Flutter')),
      body: FutureBuilder(
        future: Supabase.instance.client.from('users').select().execute(),
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }
          if (snapshot.hasError) {
            return Center(child: Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'));
          }
          final List<dynamic> users = snapshot.data.data;
          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: users.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(title: Text(users[index]['email']));
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code snippet fetches the list of users from the Supabase `users` table and displays their email addresses in a ListView.

## Authentication and User Management in Flutter with Supabase

User authentication is crucial for most applications. Supabase provides a straightforward way to implement authentication mechanisms.

### Setting Up Email/Password Authentication

1. **Sign Up**: Implement a sign-up function using the Supabase’s auth feature:

```dart
Future<void> signUp(String email, String password) async {
  final response = await Supabase.instance.client.auth.signUp(email, password);
  if (response.error != null) {
    print('Sign up error: ${response.error.message}');
  } else {
    print('User signed up: ${response.user.email}');
  }
}
```

2. **Login**: Implement a login function:

```dart
Future<void> login(String email, String password) async {
  final response = await Supabase.instance.client.auth.signIn(email: email, password: password);
  if (response.error != null) {
    print('Login error: ${response.error.message}');
  } else {
    print('User logged in: ${response.user.email}');
  }
}
```

3. **Logout**: To log out the user:

```dart
Future<void> logout() async {
  await Supabase.instance.client.auth.signOut();
  print('User logged out');
}
```

### Social Authentication

Supabase supports social authentication as well. For instance, to implement Google login:

```dart
final response = await Supabase.instance.client.auth.signInWithProvider(Provider.google);
```

This method will redirect the user to a Google sign-in page. Successful authentication will return the user's info.

## Real-Time Data Handling in Flutter with Supabase

One of the standout features of Supabase is its real-time capabilities. You can set up real-time listeners to react to database changes instantly.

### Setting Up Real-Time Listeners

Here’s how you can listen for changes in the `users` table:

```dart
void listenToUserChanges() {
  Supabase.instance.client
      .from('users')
      .on(SupabaseEventTypes.insert, (payload) {
        print('New user added: ${payload.newRecord}');
      }).subscribe();
}
```

This code snippet will print details to the console whenever a new user is added to the `users` table.

### Real-Time Updates in a Chat Application

To showcase real-time capabilities, consider a collaborative chat application where users can send messages. Set up a `messages` table and listen for new messages:

```dart
void listenToMessages() {
  Supabase.instance.client
      .from('messages')
      .on(SupabaseEventTypes.insert, (payload) {
        print('New message: ${payload.newRecord}');
      }).subscribe();
}
```

## Storing and Serving Files with Supabase Storage

Supabase offers a storage feature that allows you to manage and serve files easily. This section will guide you through uploading and retrieving files.

### Configuring Storage Buckets

1. **Create a Bucket**: In the Supabase dashboard, navigate to the Storage section and create a new bucket. For example, create a bucket named `uploads`.

### Uploading Files

To upload files from your Flutter app, use the following code:

```dart
Future<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {
  final file = File(filePath);
  final response = await Supabase.instance.client.storage.from('uploads').upload('file_name', file);
  if (response.error != null) {
    print('Upload error: ${response.error.message}');
  } else {
    print('File uploaded!');
  }
}
```

### Retrieving Files

You can retrieve files using the following code snippet:

```dart
Future<void> getFile() async {
  final response = await Supabase.instance.client.storage.from('uploads').download('file_name');
  if (response.error != null) {
    print('Download error: ${response.error.message}');
  } else {
    print('File downloaded!');
  }
}
```
