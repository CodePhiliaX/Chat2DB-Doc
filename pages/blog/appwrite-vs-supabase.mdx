Appwrite supports various authentication methods, including OAuth providers like Google and GitHub, along with traditional email/password systems. This versatility allows developers to implement user sign-ups and logins with ease. Additionally, Appwrite’s role-based access control (RBAC) enhances security by enabling permissions to be defined based on user roles.

Here’s a sample code snippet demonstrating user signup using Appwrite's SDK:

```javascript
const sdk = require('node-appwrite');

// Initialize Appwrite client
let client = new sdk.Client();
let account = new sdk.Account(client);

client
    .setEndpoint('https://[YOUR-ENDPOINT]') // Your API endpoint
    .setProject('[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]') // Your project ID
    .setKey('[YOUR-API-KEY]'); // Your secret API key

// Sign up a new user
account.create('[USER-ID]', '[EMAIL]', '[PASSWORD]')
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

### Supabase’s Authentication System

**Supabase** also provides a straightforward authentication framework that integrates seamlessly with OAuth providers and includes real-time authentication features. Its extensive documentation offers clear guidance on implementing authentication workflows.

// Initialize Supabase client
const supabase = createClient('https://[YOUR-SUPABASE-URL]', '[YOUR-ANON-KEY]');

// Sign up a new user
const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email: '[EMAIL]',
    password: '[PASSWORD]',
});

if (error) {
    console.error(error);
} else {
    console.log('User signed up:', user);
}
```

Both platforms excel in providing robust authentication options, but Supabase’s real-time capabilities provide a slight advantage in scenarios requiring immediate feedback for user actions.
