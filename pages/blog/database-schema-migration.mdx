Database schema migration, also known as database migration, schema evolution or simply migration, is the process of modifying the structure of objects in a relational database. Migrations allow the database schema to be incrementally updated from its current state to a target state, which may involve creating new tables or views, modifying field types, or adjusting constraints.

For example, adding a new table can be achieved by running the corresponding SQL statements in a terminal connected to a MySQL server. After executing these commands, you will have completed the migration of the database.

```SQL
-- Add a table
CREATE TABLE `staff` (
  `employee_id` int NOT NULL COMMENT 'Employee ID',
  `full_name` varchar(255) COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`employee_id`)
);
```

## Two Types of Database Migrations 

There are two main types of database migrations:

- Migration-based migration
- State-based migration 

### Migration-Based Migration

`Migration-Based Migration` (also known as change-based migration) is a process of incrementally modifying an existing database schema by creating a series of scripts until the target state is reached. Each script typically contains DDL statements, such as CREATE, ALTER, or DROP table operations.

The advantage of this approach is that it allows for rapid iterations of modifications to the database schema. For large and complex database systems, this approach makes it easy to implement necessary changes without having to fully understand the entire schema. By writing scripts and applying them sequentially, the migration process becomes more lightweight and efficient.

However, this approach also has its drawbacks. Over time, the full picture of the database schema can become difficult to infer, especially after multiple migrations, which can easily lead to confusion or errors. In addition, the order in which the scripts are executed is critical. If the scripts are not executed in the correct order, the expected schema may not be achieved, or the scripts may fail during the application process.

### State-Based Migration

`State-Based Migration` is an alternative to `Migration-Based Migration` that is more complex. It works by generating a script that describes the target state of the entire database schema. It does this by comparing the current state of the database with the target state, generating a difference file, and applying these difference files to the database to bring it to the target state. The generated script is similar to the schema dump files generated by the mysqldump or pg_dump tools.

The advantage of `State-Based Migration` is that it can generate a file that fully describes the state of the database at any time, which is very suitable for CI/CD workflows for databases. However, the generated scripts require careful review by experienced developers to avoid potential data loss risks. For example, a state-based migration may rename a table by dropping the existing table and recreating it with a new name, in which case someone must notice this and take steps to protect the data from loss.

Both schema migration strategies are intended to simplify the process of modifying the database schema. Which approach you choose depends on the way your development team works and the needs of the project. In some cases, a combination of the two approaches can achieve a more efficient migration.

## Future trends in database migration

With the continuous advancement of technology, database migration presents the following major trends:

### 1. Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)

The trend of incorporating database architecture migration into CI/CD workflows is becoming more and more obvious. This enables changes in the production environment to be deployed more frequently and seamlessly. Through CI/CD tools and platforms, database administrators (DBAs) can easily deploy architecture scripts to multiple databases with just a few clicks. This not only speeds up the migration process, but also reduces the possibility of human errors and minimizes the risk of service interruptions.

### 2. Team collaboration

With the popularity of the DevOps model, the collaboration between application developers and DBAs has become more important and valuable. In a DevOps team, developers and DBAs work closely together from project planning to deployment. This model breaks down information silos, enabling both parties to share information and work more efficiently.

### 3. Data governance and compliance

With increasingly stringent data privacy and security regulations, it is critical to ensure that database migration meets these requirements. This may require incorporating data governance and compliance checks into the migration process, along with improved tools to audit and document schema changes.

### 4. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence(AI)

With the rise of technologies such as OpenAI, the potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence to be used in various industries continues to expand, and the database sector is no exception. AI technologies are being used to improve the management and operation of databases. For example, Text2SQL tools such as [Chat2DB](https://chat2db.ai/zh-CN) use AI capabilities to make it easy for non-technical people to interact with databases. In the future, machine learning and AI are expected to play a key role in database schema migration, such as identifying potential problems, optimizing the migration process, and suggesting schema improvements based on data usage and performance patterns.

In summary, the future of database schema migration is likely to be characterized by integration with CI/CD workflows, valuable collaboration within teams, a focus on data governance and compliance, and the increasing use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. These trends will help ensure that schema migrations are more efficient, secure, compliant with evolving regulations, and smarter.
