<video src="https://cdn.chat2db-ai.com/website/video/demo.mp4" controls />

Over the past year, our open-source project [Chat2DB](https://github.com/codePhiliaX/Chat2DB) has proven its immense value in database management and data analysis, with nearly a million downloads by users to date.

But we didn't stop there. After months of refining details, today we're excited to announce the release of Chat2DB Pro 1.0. We've enhanced AI capabilities and made qualitative leaps in product details, significantly improving efficiency in writing SQL and generating reports. Moreover, we've restructured the entire front-end and back-end architecture to make the product more stable. The long-awaited support for redis and snowflake is also included in this version. Additionally, we've addressed various issues reported by the community version, such as slow startup and port occupation, and have thoroughly fixed all known bugs.

Chat2DB Pro 1.0 marks a new beginning. We are committed to investing more effort to provide users with better products and services.

Let me introduce you to a few key features:
