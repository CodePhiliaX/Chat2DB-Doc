- **8** is the major version, indicating significant changes or new features.
- **0** is the minor version, suggesting minor updates or additional features.
- **26** is the patch version, representing bug fixes and small improvements.

### Importance of Version Understanding

Knowing the structure of MySQL version numbers helps developers assess the type of changes introduced in a new release, from major feature releases to minor improvements and bug fixes. This understanding can lead to better decision-making regarding when to upgrade and what features to leverage.

## Common Issues with MySQL Versions and How to Resolve Them

Developers often encounter issues stemming from MySQL version discrepancies. Here are some common problems and solutions:
