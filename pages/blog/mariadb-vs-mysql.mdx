It’s time to take a deeper look at this long-standing debate: **Is MariaDB really better than MySQL**?

![materialized-views](/image/blog/mariadb/1.png)

## MariaDB and MySQL are siblings… but over time, they took different paths

MariaDB was originally a fork of MySQL, which is important because they share more than just a passing resemblance, but share the same core. In 2009, MySQL’s original creators, concerned about the prospects of Oracle’s acquisition of MySQL, decided to forge a new path: “We can do it better, or at least differently.”

Initially, both MariaDB and MySQL had strong transaction support, strict ACID compliance, and a broad ecosystem of management tools. Both performed well on a variety of platforms, provided comprehensive index handling capabilities and common SQL features. If you mastered one, it would not be too difficult to adapt to the other.

However, as they evolved, they gradually diverged. MySQL focused primarily on improvements to its InnoDB storage engine, strengthening ACID compliance and introducing performance enhancements such as JSON support and replication optimizations. MariaDB, on the other hand, expanded its own storage engine options, such as Aria and ColumnStore, to handle diverse workloads from analytical to high-performance.

In terms of compatibility, MariaDB retains backward compatibility to ensure that users can easily transition from MySQL. However, MySQL did not give the same return to MariaDB. MariaDB is supported by the community, maintains the open source spirit, and promotes innovation and collaboration. MySQL is supported by Oracle, relying on enterprise-level development and maintenance, focusing on integration with Oracle products, and providing confidence for enterprises that value stability and commercial support.

## Speed and stability: like racing cars running side by side

In terms of performance, both MariaDB and MySQL have shown strong strength, especially when dealing with large data sets and high-intensity workloads. MariaDB has optimized certain queries and is more agile in handling concurrent connections and complex queries. MySQL has also continuously improved its performance, especially in enterprise-level application scenarios, showing excellent stability and scalability.

What these two databases have in common is their excellent reliability and speed. MariaDB often emphasizes that it responds faster when handling complex queries and manages concurrent connections more smoothly. MySQL is known for its stability and scalability in large-scale deployments, especially in enterprise-level environments that require high reliability.

Compatibility is also a strong point for both, and MariaDB proudly claims to be a seamless replacement for MySQL, ensuring that users can easily switch with almost zero risk.

## Feature-rich? No doubt.

MariaDB and MySQL both offer powerful toolsets and seem to compete with each other to see who can offer more similar features. They both support comprehensive SQL capabilities, best-in-class transaction management (to keep your data as stable as your morning coffee), and optimize performance through multiple storage engines. In addition, they provide strong security, including fine-grained access control and SSL support to ensure that your data is safe and secure.

With similar replication technology and the ability to be extended through plugins, choosing MariaDB or MySQL often comes down to personal preference.

## Open Source vs. Enterprise Solutions

So far, the difference between MariaDB and MySQL doesn’t seem that big, right? But here’s where the differences start to show.

Whichever database you choose, it’s necessary to consider licensing and cost. The community editions of MariaDB and MySQL are both open source, which means they can be used for free under the GPL license. This open source nature not only allows users to freely modify and distribute their modified versions, but also provides great flexibility and transparency.

However, both MySQL and MariaDB also offer paid enterprise editions. The enterprise editions include additional features designed for enterprise environments, such as more advanced security mechanisms, auditing capabilities, and extended support services. These features help meet the higher requirements of enterprises for databases, but they also mean higher costs. Therefore, enterprises often consider the enterprise edition as a major investment when they need advanced features beyond the open source community edition.

Next, let’s take a look at some of the differences in each enterprise edition.

### Feature Spotlight

**MySQL Enterprise Edition**: This edition targets high availability, scalability, security, and manageability, which are critical for large deployments. It includes advanced replication, automatic failover, and performance monitoring tools.

**MariaDB Enterprise Server**: Provides advanced features tailored for specific workloads, such as columnar storage for analytics and geospatial indexing, while facilitating integration with other open source tools.

### Licensing Model

**MySQL Enterprise Edition**: Uses a proprietary licensing model and charges a subscription fee, reflecting its enterprise support.

**MariaDB Enterprise Server**: Offers a hybrid licensing model, with commercial subscriptions that provide comprehensive support and a fully open source option with more limited support.

### Community and Support

**MySQL Enterprise Edition**: Backed by Oracle, providing access to its support infrastructure and development expertise.

**MariaDB Enterprise Server**: Backed by MariaDB Corporation and benefits from the open source community that contributes to its development and innovation.

The differences between open source and enterprise products highlight not only the technical understanding of database systems, but also the need to have a deep understanding of their licensing models. Organizations need to find a balance between the advanced features and support that come with MySQL or MariaDB Enterprise Edition, and the costs associated with such editions. For some users, the open source community editions of MariaDB or MySQL are sufficient to provide the required functionality and community support; but for others, they may need to rely on the features and support of the enterprise editions to meet more complex needs.

## Different Flavors of the Same Dish?

Perhaps there is no clear “better” choice. In fact, MariaDB isn’t necessarily “better” than MySQL… they’re just slightly different. Choosing between MariaDB and MySQL isn’t about finding a clear winner, but about meeting specific needs and personal preferences. Key factors to weigh include feature set, performance requirements, integration with the existing ecosystem, and fit with future roadmaps.

For example, an enterprise that wants full open source and relies on strong community support might lean toward MariaDB, while companies that require strict compatibility with existing MySQL code and prioritize high availability might lean toward MySQL. If your application needs to deeply leverage advanced JSON features or integration with Oracle, MySQL might be a better fit for your needs.

But here’s another question to consider: if MariaDB and MySQL become more different in the future, will your application still work? Can you adapt to all the changes in a timely manner?

So here's a suggestion: If you're hesitant about MariaDB or MySQL because of their open source nature, but you need enterprise-level features and advanced management support, have you considered using Chat2DB to simplify and optimize your database management?
