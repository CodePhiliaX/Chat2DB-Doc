# Setting Up Your Oracle Linux Environment

To set up Oracle Linux for development purposes, follow these initial steps:

## Downloading Oracle Linux

Begin by downloading the latest ISO file from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud. This ensures you have the most recent updates and security patches. Visit the Oracle website and select the appropriate version based on your needs.

## Creating a Bootable USB or DVD

Once downloaded, create a bootable USB or DVD to facilitate the installation process. Hereâ€™s how to do it using a USB drive:

1. **Insert the USB drive**: Ensure that it has at least 8 GB of space and back up any important data, as this process will erase the drive.
2. **Use a tool like Rufus or dd**: For Windows, Rufus is user-friendly. For Linux, you can use the `dd` command:
   ```bash
   dd if=/path/to/oracle-linux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
   ```
   Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB device identifier.
3. **Eject the USB drive**: Safely remove the USB drive once the process is complete.

## Installation Options

During installation, you will encounter different options:

- **Graphical Interface**: Ideal for users who prefer a visual setup.
- **Text-based Interface**: Suitable for advanced users comfortable with command-line interfaces.

Choose the one that best fits your experience level.

## Hard Drive Partitioning

Efficiently partition your hard drive based on your requirements. Common partitioning schemes include:

- **Separate partitions for `/home`**: This allows for easier upgrades and data management.
- **Swap partition**: Useful for systems with lower RAM to enhance performance.

## Configuring Network Settings

During installation, configure your network settings to ensure seamless connectivity post-installation. This typically involves:

- Selecting the correct network interface.
- Setting up a static IP or using DHCP as per your network requirements.

## User Account Setup

Set up essential user accounts and manage access privileges. Create a non-root user for daily activities and assign appropriate permissions to maintain a secure environment.

## System Updates

Immediately after installation, update your system to patch vulnerabilities and enhance performance. Use the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf update
```

This command ensures all packages are up-to-date.
