## Understanding Proprietary DBMS: What Sets Them Apart

Proprietary DBMS refers to database management systems owned by specific vendors, involving licensing agreements that restrict access to the underlying source code. Unlike open-source databases, proprietary DBMS offer a suite of vendor-specific features, including exclusive support and maintenance. Organizations often choose proprietary systems to ensure stability and accountability, especially in enterprise environments where data integrity is critical.

### Key Characteristics of Proprietary DBMS

- **Licensing Fees**: Users must pay for licenses, which can vary based on deployment size.
- **Vendor Support**: Comprehensive support services ensure quick issue resolution.
- **Security Compliance**: Proprietary systems come with robust security protocols and compliance measures to meet regulatory standards.
