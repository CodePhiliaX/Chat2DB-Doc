## What is a database index and why is it important?

A database index is a special data structure designed to increase the speed of retrieving data from database tables. Indexes work by creating shortcuts to rows of data so that there is no need to scan the entire table row by row to find the required information. While indexes can significantly speed up read operations, they also require additional storage space and require maintenance when data is inserted, updated, or deleted, which can slightly reduce the performance of write operations.

Indexes are important because they can greatly improve the performance of a database system. Without indexes, a database management system (DBMS) must perform a full table scan (i.e., examine every row in the table) to find data that meets certain criteria. With indexes, the DBMS can more quickly locate where the data is, reducing the number of I/O operations required and speeding up response times.

## How are database indexes created?

Indexes are usually created based on one or more table columns. The process of creating an index involves creating a separate data structure for these columns that contains the index key values and their pointers to the associated data rows. When a query involves an indexed column, the database can use the index to quickly find the required row. Indexes can be created through SQL statements from the database management system, such as `CREATE INDEX`.

Suppose we have a table called `employees` and we want to create a composite index on the `last_name` and `first_name` columns on this table:

```SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_names
ON employees (last_name, first_name);
```

## What are the different types of database indexes?

Understanding the different types of database indexes is essential for optimizing query performance and data retrieval operations. The most common types of indexes include:

### Clustered Indexes

Clustered indexes reorder table data to match the index, which means that the data actually stored in the table is arranged according to the order of the index key values. This approach is very suitable for range queries and can effectively improve data retrieval efficiency.

- Each table can only have one unique clustered index because it refers to the actual storage order of the data in the table.
- Clustered indexes can achieve faster data retrieval for queries that require sorting or finding records based on a certain range.
- However, clustered indexes may cause performance degradation for data modification operations such as inserts, updates, and deletes because each modification may require adjusting the sorted data.

### Nonclustered Indexes

Nonclustered indexes are stored separately from the actual data in the table. They contain a sorted list of key values and pointers to the corresponding data rows in the table, which can achieve efficient data retrieval even if the table itself is not sorted by the index key.

- Nonclustered indexes can be created on multiple columns, providing more flexibility for different query requirements.
- Nonclustered indexes can provide better performance for queries that need to perform searches, filters, or joins between tables.
- However, nonclustered indexes take up additional storage space and may impact write performance because they need to be maintained when inserting, updating, or deleting.

### Composite indexes

Compound indexes are indexes built on multiple columns to optimize the performance of queries that contain multiple conditions by utilizing those columns simultaneously. Composite indexes are particularly effective for more complex queries that require filtering or sorting based on multiple columns.

- Composite indexes can significantly improve query performance by reducing the number of rows that need to be scanned.
- This index structure is particularly beneficial for queries that contain multiple WHERE clauses.
- However, to ensure the best results, careful consideration should be given to the design of composite indexes to ensure that the appropriate columns are included.

### Partial indexes

Partial indexes are built on a subset of a table to improve the performance of a specific query. Partial indexes are particularly effective when only a subset of the data is frequently accessed.

- Partial indexes can reduce the storage space required compared to indexes covering the entire table.
- They can improve the performance of queries on specific pieces of data, such as active records or recent transaction records.
- However, detailed analysis is required to determine which subset of data should be indexed.

## What are the benefits of data indexing?

### 1. Improve query efficiency

Index speeds up the data retrieval process and reduces the time required to execute queries. By reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned during the search process, indexes can significantly improve query performance.

### 2. Improve data acquisition

Index improves data access efficiency by reducing the number of input and output operations required to retrieve data from disk. This reduces the response time of data retrieval operations.

### 3. Enhance sorting operations

Index allows the database to focus on sorting related rows, thereby enhancing the performance of sorting operations. This is especially important for queries that contain an ORDER BY clause.

### 4. Maintain stable performance

Index helps maintain consistent query performance even as the database grows in size. This ensures that the system can maintain reliable and predictable performance levels over the long term.

## How do data indexes support data governance?

Data indexes play a key role in data governance by enhancing data accessibility, ensuring data quality, assisting compliance and security measures, and promoting data management practices.

### 1. Enhance data accessibility

Indexes make data more accessible by accelerating the data retrieval process, which is an important factor in achieving real-time decision-making and enhancing business operation efficiency.

### 2. Ensure data quality

Properly used indexes can help maintain data accuracy by enforcing constraints such as uniqueness and referential integrity, and avoid data redundancy or inconsistency.

### 3. Assist compliance and security

Appropriate indexes can help organizations quickly identify and manage their sensitive information and ensure compliance with relevant data governance policies and regulatory standards.

### 4. Promote data management

Indexes facilitate multiple data management activities including data archiving, retrieval, and cleansing by supporting efficient access to large data collections.
