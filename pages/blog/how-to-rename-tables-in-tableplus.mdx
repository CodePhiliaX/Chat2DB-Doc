| **Identify Tables to Rename** | Determine which tables require renaming and the reasons behind these changes, whether for clarity or correcting naming inconsistencies. |
| **Understand Key Terms** | Familiarize yourself with terms such as "schema" (a logical container holding your database structure) and "table" (a collection of related data entries). |
| **Assess Dependencies** | Renaming tables can impact existing queries, scripts, and applications. Check for dependencies and references within the database to avoid breaking changes. |

By adequately preparing, you can mitigate risks associated with renaming tables in TablePlus.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Renaming Tables in TablePlus

Now that you are prepared, let's walk through the step-by-step process of renaming tables in TablePlus:

3. **Right-Click on the Table**: Once you've found the target table, right-click on it to open a context menu.
4. **Select 'Rename'**: From the context menu, choose the 'Rename' option. This allows you to edit the table name directly.
5. **Choose a New Name**: Enter a meaningful and consistent new name for the table. This step is crucial for maintaining clarity and organization within your database.
6. **Confirm the Change**: After entering the new name, confirm the change. TablePlus will automatically update the name throughout the database, ensuring consistency.
