## 1. Overview
This document describes how to use the various functions of the database team management interface. The interface is mainly divided into four major modules: **Team Settings**, **Member Management**, **Approval List**, **Permission Management**, and **SQL Audit**.

## 2. Team Management
### 2.1 Team Settings
The team settings module is mainly used to manage and configure the basic information of the team. Users can perform the following operations in this module:
- Edit team information: modify the organization name information. **Only super administrators** have the authority to modify the team avatar and organization name! The organization number is unique and cannot be modified once created.
- Transfer organization: Transfer the owner rights of the team to other members. **Only super administrators** have the authority to transfer!

!['teamwork2'](/image/teamwork/teamwork2.png)

- Subscription plan: You can upgrade the team PRO package and invite more members to join! **All members** can upgrade the package! The minimum number of seats subscribed is no less than 5! (This does not mean adding 5 people to the original 3 seats, but the total number of seats is 5)

When you order for the first time, the system defaults to the package starting from the current time. When you purchase again, it will be renewed based on the original purchased time. It is equivalent to extending the time.

> Pay attention to the difference between renewal and adding seats! ! !

!['teamwork3'](/image/teamwork/teamwork3.png)

When you purchase next time, the default will be calculated from the latest package end time.

If you just want to add seats, please upgrade the seats in the `Member Management` interface.

### 2.2 Member Management
The member management module is used to manage members in the team. Users can perform the following operations:

- View member list: View detailed information of all members in the team. **Super administrator** can see members who have not yet joined the team under approval (displayed as not effective).

!['teamwork5'](/image/teamwork/teamwork5.png)

- Edit member information: **Super administrator** can set ordinary members as administrators, and can also cancel administrator qualifications.

!['teamwork6'](/image/teamwork/teamwork6.png)

!['teamwork7'](/image/teamwork/teamwork7.png)

- Invite members and upgrade seats: **Super Admins and Admins** can copy the link and send it to invite members. When the membership is full, all members can upgrade their seats. The number of non-member teams is 3. Ineffective members do not occupy formal member seats.

!['teamwork8'](/image/teamwork/teamwork8.png)

Only after the first subscription to the package will there be an `upgrade seat`, which is equivalent to increasing the number of people after a certain period of time.

> Pay attention to the difference between renewal and increase of seats! ! !

- Remove user: **Only super administrators and administrators** can remove a member from the team. Members who have not yet joined the team, that is, members who have not yet taken effect, cannot be removed.

### 2.3 Subscription record
The subscription record module is used to view the operation subscription records of team members. **All members** can view the subscription status of all members and the corresponding operation records here.

## 3. Approval list (not viewable by ordinary users)
The approval list module is used to process and review various applications of team members, including applications to join the team, applications for data permissions, etc. The approval list contains the following columns:
- Approval flow ID: The unique identifier of each approval request.
- Approval name: The name or description of the approval request.
- Approval status: Displays the status of the current approval request (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).
- Operation: View the details of the approval request.

!['teamwork12'](/image/teamwork/teamwork12.png)

Users can perform the following operations in this module:
- View approval requests: **Only super administrators and administrators** can view the approval requests they have agreed to. Simply put, whoever agrees to the application request will display the corresponding approval record on the interface.
- Approve or reject requests: Review and process member requests. **Only super administrators and administrators** can operate.

## 4. Permission management
The permission management module is used to manage the permissions of team members, and is divided into two sub-modules: authorization list and application list.
### 4.1 Authorization list (administrator)
The authorization list is used to view and manage the permissions granted to team members. Users can perform the following operations:
- View authorized members: **Only super administrators and administrators** can view all authorized members and their details. Authorized members cannot view. The principle is the same as `approval list`.

!['teamwork13'](/image/teamwork/teamwork13.png)

!['teamwork14'](/image/teamwork/teamwork14.png)

- Authorized administrators: **Only super administrators and administrators** can select the users who need to be authorized, the data sources that users need to access, and whether the permissions are permanent. Click the `Submit` button to save the authorization information to the system.

!['teamwork15'](/image/teamwork/teamwork15.png)

!['teamwork16'](/image/teamwork/teamwork16.png)

- Authorized data permissions: **Only super administrators and administrators** can select the users who need to be authorized, the data sources that users need to access, and the expiration date of the permissions. Click the `Submit` button to save the authorization information to the system. Subsequent versions will divide permissions into more detailed ranges, row filtering, and other permissions, so stay tuned!

### 4.2 Application List (Ordinary Members)
The application list is used to view and process permission applications submitted by team members. Users can perform the following operations here:

!['teamwork19'](/image/teamwork/teamwork19.png)

- View application requests: **Only super administrators and administrators** can view all pending permission applications.
- Approve or reject applications: **Only super administrators and administrators** can review and process member permission applications.
- Apply for data permissions: **All members except super administrators** can apply for data permissions, data sources to be accessed, and permission expiration time. Subsequent versions will divide permissions into scopes, row filters, and other permissions in more detail, so stay tuned!

## 5. SQL Audit (Ordinary members cannot view)
The SQL Audit module is used to review the SQL operation records of team members. Super administrators and administrators can view the SQL records executed by all members, their operation time, and detailed information about the operation users. Ordinary members do not have the right to view.
