After opening the link, you can see the database management interface, and you can add, delete, modify and query the database.

## View management table
!['tables'](/image/connection-manage/tables.png)

**Tables (tables)**: Tables are the most basic data storage structure in the database, used to organize and store data. Each table consists of a series of columns, which define the type and format of the stored data (such as text, date, number, etc.), and each row in the table represents a specific record.
The `tables` interface allows you to view tables in the database, create, refresh, copy, view all tables, and create a new console.

## View management view
!['views'](/image/connection-manage/views.png)

**Views**: A view is a virtual table whose content is obtained by querying other tables. Views do not store data, but dynamically generate result sets as needed. It is often used to simplify complex queries, hide the complexity of the database, implement data security control (by restricting access to the data of the underlying table), and provide customized data perspectives to different users or applications.
Click the `view` menu on the left to view views in the database, create, refresh, and view all views. Double-click to view view details.

## View management function
!['functions'](/image/connection-manage/functions.png)

**Functions**: In the database context, a function is a set of predefined or user-defined operations that perform specific tasks and return one or more values. Functions can accept parameter inputs, perform calculations or data operations based on the inputs, and return results. They help to reuse code and improve efficiency. Database functions can be divided into system functions (such as date processing, string processing, etc.) and user-defined functions (UDF), the latter of which allows developers to expand the functionality of the database as needed.
Click the left menu `functions` to view the functions in the database, and you can create, refresh, and view all functions.

## View management procedures
!['procedures'](/image/connection-manage/procedures.png)

**Procedures (stored procedures)**: A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that are precompiled and stored in the database to complete a specific task. Compared to executing SQL statements alone, stored procedures provide a more flexible and efficient way to execute complex business logic. Stored procedures can receive input parameters, perform a series of operations (including data operations, function calls, etc.), and return result sets or output parameters.
Click the left menu `functions` to view the stored procedures in the database, and you can create, refresh, and view all stored procedures.

## View management triggers
!['triggers'](/image/connection-manage/triggers.png)

**Triggers**: A trigger is a database object that defines a SQL statement that is automatically executed when a specific event occurs in the database. A trigger can be triggered during an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation, or during a SELECT operation. A trigger can execute any valid SQL statement, including data operations, function calls, etc.
Click the left menu `triggers` to view the triggers in the database, and you can create, refresh, and view all triggers.
