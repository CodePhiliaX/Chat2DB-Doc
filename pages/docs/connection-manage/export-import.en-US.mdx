# Export and Import

You can use a variety of methods to export data and object structures from a database. In addition, you can export data in SQL, CSV, XLS, XLSX formats.
In Chat2DB, you can export object structures and data separately. This means that you can export the structure of a table or view and then export data from those objects.

[Here](https://docs.chat2db.ai/en-US/docs/start-guide/user-interface-overview#status-bar-%E7%8A%B6%E6%80%81%E6%A0%8F) to see the progress of the export.

## Export Object Structure

> Tip: It is recommended not to change the data during the export process to prevent any potential data integrity issues.

### Export the entire database

1. Select the database for which you want to export the object structure and click `Export structure only`.
