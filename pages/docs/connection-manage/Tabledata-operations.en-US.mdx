For a series of operations on the table, we will introduce them separately:

!['total'](/image/connection-manage/total.png)

- `Open Table`: open the table structure to view data
- `Query console`: Create a new console based on this database
- `Pin`: pin list
- `View DDL`: View the DDL statements of the table
- `Copy name`: copy the table name
- `Edit Table`: Edit table (table name, comments, column names, primary keys...)
- `Delete Table`: delete table

## View data

When you **double-click** a table in Database Explorer (View | Tool Windows | Database Explorer), the table, view, opens in the Data Editor.
Or you can right-click the mouse to select the table you want to view and click `Open Table` to view it!

## Edit data

You can make modifications directly in the table. After modifying the data, submit it and the modification will be successful!

!['update'](/image/connection-manage/directUpdate.png)

When our field names are too long to be modified or viewed directly from the table, we can select the data to be viewed or modified, then right-click and click `View/Edit Data` to view and edit the page.

In addition, you can also view the DDL statements for specific modification operations:

## Refresh data

If you want to synchronize the data you see in the editor with the contents of the database, you need to reload the table view's data.

- Click the `refresh` button on the toolbar.
