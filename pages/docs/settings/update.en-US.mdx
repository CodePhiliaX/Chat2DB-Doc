# Check for updates


!['update'](/image/settings/update.png)

By default, Chat2DB is configured to automatically check for updates and notify you when a new version is released. Updates are usually hot updates and do not require manual installation.

Additionally, if Chat2DB does not have HTTP access outside the local network, it will not be able to check for updates and hot-update.
