# Fail to Activate License

# Local License Activation Failure

When activating Chat2DB Local, if you encounter a license activation failure, there are usually a few possible reasons. Please check the specific situation and take the appropriate measures to resolve the issue.

## 1. Incorrect Activation Code

The entered activation code is incorrect, possibly due to a spelling error or incorrect format.

**Solution:**

- Please carefully verify that the activation code you entered matches exactly with the one you received at the time of purchase.
- Ensure there are no extra spaces and that the letter case is correct.
- If you still cannot activate, please contact customer support for further assistance.

## 2. Maximum Number of Bound Devices Reached

Each License can be bound to a maximum of 2 devices by default. Please ensure that your License has not reached the maximum number of bound devices.

## 3. The Device Was Not Properly Unbound from the Previous License

Your device may not have been properly unbound from the previous License. Please confirm whether you followed the normal unbinding process. Refer to: [Local License Activation/Unbinding](/docs/start-guide/activate-unbind-license)

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Reactivate and Unbind Using the Old License.**

  1. Go to the **Settings in the top left corner -> License** page.
