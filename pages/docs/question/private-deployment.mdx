# Chat2DB Source code deployment and Docker deployment

This project supports source code compilation deployment and Docker deployment. For simplicity, we recommend Docker deployment first!

# Docker deployment
## Command line operation:

1. Pull chat2db image

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment01.png)

2. Check the image and you can see that the pull is successful.

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment02.png)

3. Start the chat2db image, change the name (chat2db) and port number (10824), and use `docker ps` to see the running container after the startup is successful.

Command: _**docker run -itd chat2db/chat2db:latest -p 10824:10824 --name chat2db**_

## Client Docker deployment (visual operation on the client):

1. Open the docker client, search for `chat2db` in the app store, select the first 10K+ downloads, the latest version and `pull` the image

# Source code deployment
## Running environment

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment13.png)

_**Note**_: This project must be supported by Open JDK17 and above (not Oracle JDK), and the Node version must be 16 and above.

### Front-end deployment (this deployment is implemented by IDEA by default)
1. **Enter the directory**: First enter the `chat2db-client` directory of the project:

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment14.png)

2. **Compile the project**: Then run the `yarn` command to compile the front-end project and wait patiently

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment15.png)

3. **Start the project**: Use `yarn run start:web` to open the project.

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment16.png)

When the port shown in the figure below appears, it means that the startup is successful!

### Backend deployment
1. **Enter the directory**: First enter the chat2db-server directory of the project

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment18.png)

2. **Clean and compile**: Clean and compile the code, skip the test run

Command: _mvn clean install -DskipTests_

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment19.png)

3. **Enter the target directory**:

Command: _cd chat2db-server-start/target_

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment20.png)

4. **Start the program**: Start the Java backend program (this deployment is implemented by IDEA by default), start it directly in the startup class of IDEA

!['image'](/image/questions/deployment21.png)

After completing the above steps, you can see that the web page has been successfully opened! The web page startup port is 8000.

**Problems you may encounter:**

_**Windows:**_

Problem 1: Error when preparing to start the project with yarn:

> yarn: Unable to load file
> C:\Users\AppData\Roaming\npm\yarn.ps1 because running scripts is prohibited on this system. For more information, see
> about_Execution_Policies in
> https:/go.microsoft. com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Location Line: 1 Character: 1

**Solution**: Open the Windows PowerShell command window and use the command to find that Windows automatically prohibits running scripts (first line), and allows this system to run scripts (second line)

```bash
Get-ExecutionPolicy
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Problem 2: Yarn reports the following error during installation:

> Yarn: The term "yarn" cannot be recognized as the name of a
> cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program. Please check the spelling of the name, and if the path is included, make sure the path is correct and try again. Location Line: 1 Character: 1

**Solution**: First check the version of node, then download yarn.

```bash
PS E:\Chat2DB\chat2db-client> node --version (check if node meets the project running requirements)
PS E:\Chat2DB\chat2db-client> npm i -g yarn (download and install yarn)
```

```

**Solution**:
1. Check if there is a problem with the project's Maven configuration and make sure the JDK version you use is compatible with Maven Project compatibility:

2. Check and set JAVA_HOME, make sure your system is configured with the correct JAVA_HOME environment variable, and that the variable points to a compatible JDK version, and configure the following content to ~/.zshrc
