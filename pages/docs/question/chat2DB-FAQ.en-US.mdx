## Frequently Asked Questions
### Q: Why can't I use OpenAI even after I accessed the Internet
A: If the webpage gpt can chat normally, it means that your VPN is only effective for the browser, not globally, and it is not effective for some Java applications. You can manually configure the proxy in the chat2db client.

> Need to configure:
> * HTTP Proxy Host is usually 127.0.0.1
> * HTTP Proxy Port The local port number of the VPN software proxy is 7890 for Clash
> * Api Host If you use the OpenAI service directly without an intermediate proxy, you don't need to fill it in

### Q: The front-end page is blank
A: Because some values stored locally on the front end cause incompatibility between the new and old versions, you can try to open the console to clear localstorage. `If the subsequent version is incompatible with v2.0.2, we will automatically clear the local storage content on the front end`

### Q: The front-end runs yarn to install dependencies, but is stuck in Electron and unresponsive
