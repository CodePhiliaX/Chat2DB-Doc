# Cannot to connect to a database

> If you are completely new to Chat2DB, please read the [Quick Start](https://docs.chat2db.ai/docs/start-guide/getting-started) guide which gives a quick overview of the first steps to using Chat2DB.

## Step 1. Check your network setup

The database can work locally or in the cloud. For server and cloud databases, you need a network connection. To verify that the connection is available, use the **ping** and **telnet** commands.

### 1. Using the ping command

The `ping` command is used to test network connectivity with another computer. It sends a small packet to the target host and waits for a reply. If a reply is received, the network connection is working.

#### Windows:

```cmd
ping [options] target name
```

- `ping` is followed by the host name or IP address you want to test.
- You can add some options, such as `-t` means to send ping packets continuously until you press `Ctrl+C` to stop; `-n` followed by a number indicates the number of times to send; `-l` followed by a number indicates the size of the packet; `-a` is a command option to resolve the address to a host name (if possible).

#### Linux / macOS:

```bash
ping [options] target name
```

- Usage is similar to Windows.

### Example:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.1
```

### 2. Use the telnet command

The `telnet` command is used to test whether a port is open. You can use it to check whether a specific service (such as a database service) is listening on a port.

#### Windows:

```cmd
telnet [host] [port]
```

- `telnet` is followed by the host name or IP address you want to test, followed by a space, followed by the port number.

#### Linux / macOS:

```bash
telnet [host] [port]
```

- Usage is similar to Windows.

### Example: This example attempts to connect to the MySQL database service on the host with IP address `192.168.1.1`, and the default port is `3306`.

```bash
telnet 192.168.1.1 3306
```

> For security reasons, DBMSs usually drop all telnet connections. The telnet command allows you to check if a port is open for communication.

### Notes:
- If you are using `telnet` on Windows 10, you may need to enable the Telnet client feature first. You can enable it by running `Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "Telnet*"} | Add-WindowsCapability` in PowerShell.
- If the `telnet` command successfully connects to the service, you will usually see some welcome message or prompt. If it fails to connect, you may get an error message or no response.
- Many modern systems do not install `telnet` by default because it is less secure. You can use `nc` (netcat) or other secure tools as an alternative.

## Step 2. Check your connection properties

Each database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or any other vendor) has its own connection settings. Most databases include connection settings:

- **Host**: The host name of the computer or other device where the database is stored. It can be the IP address **127.0.0.1** or the domain name **localhost**.
- **Database**: The name of the database you want to connect to. You can find the database name in the database server's settings or ask the database administrator. In some cases, you can run a query in the database command line to see the names of all available databases. For example, in MySQL, you can run `SHOW DATABASES;`.

!["show databases"](/image/questions/show.png)

- **User**: User name with sufficient privileges to perform operations on the database. Run a query in the database command line to see the names of all available databases. For example, in MySQL, you can run `SHOW GRANTS;`.
- **Password**: The password for the user.
- **Port**: A number that identifies a connection point between hosts. Hosts use port numbers to determine which application, service, or process a connection must be made to. Different database vendors use different ports for their databases. The following is a partial list of default port numbers:

| Database | Default Port |
|:------------:|:--------:|
| MySQL | 3306 |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 |
| Oracle | 1521 |
| SQL Server | 1433 |
| MongoDB | 27017 |
| Redis | 6379 |
| KingBase | 54321 |
| MariaDB | 3306 |
| SQLite | none |
| ClickHouse | 9000 |
| DM | 5236 |
| OceanBase | 2883 |

> The actual port numbers on your system may be different. Verify with your database administrator, server setup, or hosting provider that you are using the correct port number.

## Step 3. Check Driver Version

The JDBC driver allows you to interact with a database management system (DBMS) in Chat2DB. Each DBMS requires its own JDBC driver. Make sure the driver version and DBMS version are compatible with each other.

You can download drivers from all supported vendors from Chat2DB. You can view the list of supported vendors in the Driver List;
Or, you can upload your own driver to Chat2DB.

## Step 4. Check if SSH connection is required

To make the connection to the database more secure, some services require the use of SSH.

**Secure Shell** or **SSH** is a network protocol that encrypts the connection between the client and the server.

In Chat2DB, you can create an SSH tunnel by using `Chat2DB SSH` tunnel. Chat2DB will create the SSH tunnel using the SSH configuration you set.

!["ssh"](/image/connection/ssh.png)

- `USE SSH`: Whether to use SSH channel

- `SSH Host`: SSH server address

- `SSH Port`: SSH server port, default 22

- `Authentication`: SSH authentication method, username and password or private key

- `User`: SSH username

- `Password`: SSH password

- `Test the SSH connection`: Test whether the SSH connection is normal
