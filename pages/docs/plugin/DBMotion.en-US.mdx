### Application scenarios

#### 1. Database migration in the computer room, on-cloud and off-cloud

DBMotion supports Docker offline version and cloud version. Users can download the offline version to perform database migration in their own computer room. You can also directly use the SAAS version on the cloud to migrate on the cloud or across clouds, support migration from on-cloud to off-cloud, and support disaster recovery synchronization of RDS to ECS or offline computer rooms.

#### 2. Domestic database migration
Migrate non-domestic databases to domestic databases and overseas clouds to domestic clouds through visual transparent migration tools. Supports conversion of tables, indexes and other structures, as well as stored procedures, custom functions and other codes; through built-in expert experience and best practices, ensures efficient, transparent and secure full and incremental data synchronization, and can achieve zero downtime migration; supports object and data verification, guarantees data consistency; supports reverse synchronization and can be rolled back at any time.

#### 3. Remote multi-active data synchronization
Supports two-way synchronization of MySQL and openGauss, effectively avoids circular replication, and supports three conflict resolution strategies: overwrite, ignore and error. Supports two-site three-center/remote multi-active architecture, and supports disaster recovery drills.

---

### Advantages and features

- Zero downtime: No business downtime is required during the entire migration process, and no locks are added to the source database. The source database can perform various DDL operations during the migration process

- Convenient and intuitive: Using visual operations, you can complete data migration and verification with a few clicks of the mouse

- Concurrency and high performance: Object, full, incremental, and verification processes all use multi-threaded concurrency, and the synchronization performance can reach 40M/s

- Safe and efficient: Support SSL connection to ensure the security of transmitted data

- Stable and reliable: Support breakpoint resumption, automatic reconnection when the source end is disconnected, and automatic retry when the target end fails

- Pre-check: Pre-check in advance before the formal migration to find possible problems during the migration process in advance

- Data verification: Support data verification after migration to escort data switching

- Two-way synchronization: Actively avoid circular replication and support conflict strategy processing

- Object mapping/where condition filtering: Support object name mapping of source and target databases, and support ignoring some sensitive data during synchronization

- Hot modification: Support hot modification of synchronization objects during synchronization

- Cross-network access: You can access the intranet or RDS on the cloud through the proxy gateway

### Price

`DBMotion plugin` is free for `Chat2DB Pro` members for a limited time.

---

### Usage restrictions

#### 1. Bandwidth restrictions

The network bandwidth from the source database to DBMotion and from DBMotion to the target database will limit the migration speed. If the network bandwidth on either end is poor, the migration performance will be reduced and the migration speed will not reach the specification.

#### 2. Database performance restrictions

The performance of the source database or the target database will lead to a decline in the migration performance of DBMotion. Poor performance of the source database will cause DBMotion to retrieve data slowly, and poor performance of the target database will cause DBMotion to store data slowly.

#### 3. MySQL binlog format issues

Binlog needs to use ROW format to ensure that DBMotion can correctly parse the data modification so that it can be incrementally synchronized to the target end. When DDL changes, it is recommended to use a method similar to use db1; alter table tb1 instead of using alter table db2.tb1 to avoid DBMotion misjudging the database and making errors when judging whether the change should be filtered.

#### 4. The source database object selection cannot distinguish whether to select all nodes or all current child nodes

When selecting all tables under a schema on the interface, it cannot distinguish whether all tables displayed on the interface are checked or the entire schema is checked. Currently, synchronization is performed according to checking the entire schema, that is, all current tables under this schema and tables created later will all be synchronized to the target end.

#### 5. Too many object dependency layers will still cause an error

DBMotion currently handles object dependency layers within 10 layers. That is to say, if view v10 depends on v9, v9 depends on v8, ... v2 depends on v1, DBMotion will automatically handle it, but dependencies greater than 10 layers may cause an error.

#### 6. Tables created during object migration to full migration cannot be synchronized
The user selected to migrate the entire schema (db1), but a table db1.tb1 was created during the time interval between object migration and full migration. Since db1.tb1 does not exist when the object is migrated, the object migration will not migrate the table structure of db1.tb1, so an error will be reported during the full migration saying that the table structure does not exist.

#### 7. Others
```
Illegal mix of collations (utf8mb4_general_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci,IMPLICIT) for operation '=' MySQL 8.0 uses utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci Collation as the collation rule for utf8mb4 by default, which is different from the default value of utf8mb4_general_ci in 5.6 and 5.7. If there is a view using convert(tt.ID using utf8mb4 ), an error may occur when migrating objects to the target end, indicating Illegal mix of collations. It is recommended to manually change the view to convert(tt.ID using utf8mb4 ) COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci in the target database to bypass this problem.
```

2. **Database IP:Port**:
- Enter the IP address and port number of your original database in the `Source information` section.
- For the `Target information` section, you need to provide the IP address and port number of the target database.
3. **Account and password**:
- The `Source information` section requires you to provide the username and password to access the original database. The default username is root.
- The `Target information` section requires you to provide the username and password to access the target database.
- If you don't know the username, you can click the `Auth script` operation below to get the authorized user.
4. **SSL Transport**:

!['test_connection'](/image/plugins/plugin06.png)

#### 5. Migration Options

1. **Objects**:
- This area will list a series of database names. You can decide which database tables, views, functions, stored procedures, triggers, etc. should be included in the migration process by checking these items.

!['Migration'](/image/plugins/plugin061.png)

2. **Migration**:

**Speed**: This provides a choice of migration speed, the default is `Unlimited`, which means unlimited speed. If you need to limit the migration speed, you can change it here.

- **Migrate type**: Three options are provided - `Objects`, `Data`, and `Sync incremental`. Depending on the requirement, you can choose to migrate object definitions, data, or incremental synchronization.
- `Objects`: Indicates migrating objects in the database, such as tables, views, etc.
- `Data`: Indicates migrating data in the database.
- `Sync incremental`: Indicates incremental synchronization, migrating only the content that has changed since the last migration.

**Sync policy**: This section allows you to specify the synchronization strategy.

- **Sync topology**: You can choose unidirectional or bidirectional synchronization.
- `unidirectional`: Unidirectional synchronization, data will only be transferred from the source database flow to the target database.
- `Bidirectional`: Bidirectional synchronization, data can flow between the two databases.
- **Conflict policy**: How to deal with conflicts when they occur.
- `Cover and continue`: Overwrite existing data and continue migration.
- `Ignore and continue`: Ignore conflicts and continue migration.
- `Report an error and stop`: Report an error and stop migration.
- **Filter DDL**: Whether to filter out data definition language (DDL) statements. DDL is usually used to create, modify or delete database structures.

3. **Upload migrate object configuration file** / **Download template file**:
- If you have prepared the configuration file for the migration object, you can upload it by clicking "Upload migrate object configuration file".
- If you need to download the template file for manual editing, you can click "Download template file".

!['Migration'](/image/plugins/plugin07.png)

4. **Advanced configuration**:
- Click this link to enter a more detailed configuration page for advanced customization of the migration task.

!['Migration'](/image/plugins/plugin08.png)
!['Migration'](/image/plugins/plugin09.png)

5. **Confirm information**:
- After filling in all the necessary information, you can click `Next` to proceed to the next step.

Before performing database migration, make sure you have carefully checked all options, especially the conflict policy and synchronization strategy, as they may directly affect the results of the migration.

#### 6. Mapping and filtering

!['mapping'](/image/plugins/plugin10.png)

- Field mapping refers to mapping fields in one table to fields in another table in order to exchange or synchronize data between the two tables.
During the configuration of the MySQL database migration task, users can set the object mapping name of the library, table, and field in the target library.
As shown in the figure below, [text displayed in dark green with the -sy suffix] is the mapping name of the modified target schema, table, and field.

Note: The modified mapping name should start with an English letter, and only English letters (case-sensitive), numbers, and underscores are allowed. The length is less than or equal to 64

!['mapping'](/image/plugins/plugin11.png)

!['mapping'](/image/plugins/plugin12.png)

After the migration is completed, we enter the target library to view, and we can see that the library, table, and field are all displayed as the mapping name we set during the migration process.

!['mapping'](/image/plugins/plugin13.png)

- In data migration or data replication, where can be used to filter out the data that needs to be migrated or replicated, avoid unnecessary data transmission and processing, and improve the efficiency of migration or replication.
As shown in the figure below, during the configuration of the MySQL database migration task, click Mapping and Filtering to support free configuration of data filtering conditions. After entering the filtering conditions in the text box, move out of the text box, and you can view the filtering effect in the filtering result preview so that users can confirm whether it meets expectations.

!['mapping'](/image/plugins/plugin14.png)

After setting the filtering conditions for the table, the filtering conditions will be automatically included during the full and incremental synchronization process. Ensure that the filtered data is synchronized to the target end.
Here we set the where filtering condition: `CategoryId > 9`, and the filtering results are as follows.
- Source data display:

!['mapping'](/image/plugins/plugin15.png)

- Target data display:

!['mapping'](/image/plugins/plugin16.png)

The target database only synchronizes data with `CategoryId > 9`, which meets the target expectations.

#### 7. Final confirmation

- Objects with the same name in the target database will be rebuilt, so please check the target database carefully before migration to avoid overwriting and corrupting data. It is recommended to perform data migration during off-peak hours to reduce the impact of data updates and DDL changes.

- During the confirmation stage, users need to review the prompt information and understand potential problems and risks, such as inconsistent database versions that may cause migration failure.
At the same time, they can also review the pre-check results. If there are errors or warnings, they should resolve these issues before performing the migration. If everything is OK, users can click `Save task and execute` to save and execute the migration task or click `Save task` to temporarily save the relevant configuration information.

!['confirm'](/image/plugins/plugin17.png)

#### 8. Migration results

- When the migration is completed, users can view the migration results, including the progress, status, error information, etc.
