# Data Security

Data security is a very important part of the enterprise because data is the core asset of the enterprise. How to ensure data security is an important goal of Chat2DB.

Chat2DB ensures data security in the following ways:

## Data Storage

Chat2DB will store data in a secure data center, which has strict security measures to ensure that data is not stolen. At the same time, Chat2DB will perform asymmetric encryption and storage of the user's core confidential data, and the platform will not be able to access the user's core confidential data.

## Transmission Encryption

Chat2DB ensures the security of data during transmission through SSL/TLS encryption. SSL/TLS is an encryption protocol that ensures data is not stolen during transmission.

## Data Access
In order to ensure the security of your data to the greatest extent, we recommend that you install our Chat2DB client and access the database through the client. The local client directly connects to the user's database server without going through the Chat2DB platform.

## Private deployment

Chat2DB supports privatized deployment. Enterprises can deploy Chat2DB on their own servers, which can ensure data security to the greatest extent.
