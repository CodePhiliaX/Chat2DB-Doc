# Data Security

Data security is a vital component of an enterprise because data is the core asset of an enterprise. Ensuring data security is a core goal of **Chat2DB**.

To achieve this goal, **Chat2DB** has taken the following measures to ensure data security:

## ☀️Data Storage

- **Chat2DB** stores data in data centers that have undergone strict security certification and are equipped with advanced physical and technical security measures to prevent unauthorized data access.

- For users' sensitive information and core confidential data, **Chat2DB** implements an asymmetric encryption storage solution to ensure that even platform internal personnel cannot directly access this data.

## ☀️Transmission Encryption

Chat2DB uses **SSL/TLS protocol** to encrypt data transmission, which is an industry-standard secure communication protocol that effectively protects the security and integrity of data during transmission.

## ☀️Data Access

To maximize data security, we recommend that users install and use the Chat2DB client.
The client directly connects to the user's database server, and the data transmission does not need to pass through the Chat2DB platform, thereby reducing the potential risk of data leakage.

## ☀️Private Deployment

Chat2DB supports private deployment options, allowing enterprises to deploy the application on their own infrastructure to further enhance control and security of data.
