# AI data set

One of the highlights of Chat2DB's intelligent question-and-answer feature is its powerful ability to create custom AI datasets.

With this feature, users have the flexibility to build different sets of Q&A data, so that the content of the Q&A is highly customized, ensuring that each answer is precisely tailored to your specific needs.
Not only that, this process also greatly improves the intelligence level of the question and answer system and the accuracy of the answer, so that you are more comfortable in dealing with complex and changeable query scenarios.

In short, the custom AI data set is the key to unlocking Chat2DB intelligent question-and-answer precision service and realizing the intelligent upgrade of question-and-answer.

## Step 1: Create an ai dataset

You can use each data source to create ai data sets for that data source. Tables from one or more different databases can be placed in an ai dataset.
You can also right-click all tables on the Tables node under each database to add a specified table to the ai dataset.

If your table structure changes after you synchronize, you can right-click the dataset node to resynchronize.

## Step 2: Modify the tag name and table comment

You can edit the table by double-clicking it within the ai dataset. If your business cannot modify the table name or table comment, you can modify the table name and comment as well as the field name and comment information here, so that AI can better understand your table structure and field information.
This will greatly improve the accuracy of ai generation.
