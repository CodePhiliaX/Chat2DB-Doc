# SQL-Copilot

- **Real-time code suggestions and completion**: When users start writing SQL queries, SQL Copilot provides real-time syntax suggestions and code snippets to help users complete query writing faster.
The tool can provide relevant suggestions based on the context of the user's query statement, such as table names, field names, and functions, to reduce spelling errors and improve query accuracy.

- **Automatic SQL code generation**: Users can directly describe the data they want to query or ask questions in natural language, and SQL Copilot will automatically generate the corresponding SQL code.
Users can also let the tool generate appropriate SQL statements by providing sample data and expected results.

- **Integration and compatibility**: SQL Copilot supports multiple database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, ensuring consistent help in different environments.
Over time, SQL Copilot will learn users' habits and preferences to provide more personalized suggestions and support.
