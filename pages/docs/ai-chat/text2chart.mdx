# AI Dashboard

Chat2DB offers a powerful Dashboard functionality designed to make it easier for data analysts or any user with data analysis needs to view and understand their data more effectively. Through this feature, any charts generated via the AI Copilot can be pinned directly onto your dashboard for easy access and reference.
