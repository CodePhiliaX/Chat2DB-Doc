# SQL explanation

- **Convert SQL to natural language**: The AI model has learned how to accurately convert SQL syntax into easy-to-understand natural language expressions by training on a large number of SQL statements and their corresponding natural language descriptions.
This process involves the application of deep learning algorithms to capture the mapping relationship between SQL structure and natural language, ensuring that the converted text is both accurate and fluent.

- **Improve team communication efficiency**: By converting SQL statements to natural language, the communication efficiency of the team can be improved.
The natural language description converted in this way can help non-technical personnel quickly understand the purpose and function of SQL statements, thereby improving communication efficiency between teams and reducing errors caused by misunderstandings.
This conversion method is particularly suitable for scenarios that require cross-departmental collaboration to ensure that everyone can understand the query intent.
