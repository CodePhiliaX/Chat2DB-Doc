# Synchronize Database Schemas

To help developers efficiently manage and synchronize database schemas, Chat2DB introduces a new Database Schema Synchronization feature. Highlights of this feature include:

1. **Automated Synchronization**: With Chat2DB's database schema synchronization, users can effortlessly synchronize database tables, columns, indexes, constraints, and other structures to the target database without manually writing complex SQL statements or performing cumbersome operations. Just a few clicks automate the synchronization process, ensuring that the target database structure mirrors the source database.

2. **Multi-environment Support**: Whether it's development, testing, or production environments, Chat2DB effectively supports structural synchronization between different database instances. Through simple configurations, developers can synchronize database structures across multiple environments, ensuring consistent database structures in each, thus avoiding discrepancies between environments.

3. **Flexible Synchronization Modes**: Chat2DB offers various synchronization modes. Users can choose from full synchronization, which copies all structures from the source to the target database suitable for new databases or complete sync scenarios, or custom synchronization where specific tables or structures are selectively synchronized, ideal for more tailored needs.

4. **Support for Multiple Database Types**: Chat2DB supports several mainstream database types including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and more. Regardless of the database used, Chat2DB facilitates efficient database structure synchronization making it an invaluable tool for cross-platform database management.

**How to Use Chat2DB's Database Structure Synchronization Feature?**

Using Chat2DB for database structure synchronization is straightforward. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1: Connect to your Databases**: Ensure you have successfully connected to both the source and target databases. Whether your databases are local or remote, Chat2DB quickly connects and provides a visual interface for easy management and operation.

- **Step 2: Select Synchronization Databases**: Enter the database structure synchronization interface and select the two different databases you want to sync. Then click the "Start diff" button, and Chat2DB will calculate the schema differences between the source and target databases, and generate the suggested DDL statements.
