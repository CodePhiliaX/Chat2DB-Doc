# Complete Offline Mode

<div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'red', margin: '20px 0' }}>
Once an offline license is generated, a device must be bound to it. Once generated, an offline license cannot be revoked or transferred to a different device, and the number of available device bindings for the license decreases by one.
</div>

## Get Device ID

Choose **Offline Activation** to automatically get your Device ID:

<div style={{maxWidth: '500px'}}>

</div>

## Get Device Certificate

Go to the website to get the device certificate: http://app.chat2db-ai.com/settings/deviceCer

First log in to the account where you purchased the license, select the previous order in License ID, then fill in the device name, select the operating system, and fill in the device ID you just generated in the last column of Device ID:

</div>

## Activation your Device

Copy and paste the previously generated device certificate in the Device Certificate field to activate it:

## How to Unbind the certificate

If you need to unbind, please go to the client and remove the offline certificate by yourself.

<div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'red', margin: '20px 0' }}>
Note: If the activation is done through offline activation, then the AI function cannot be used even when you are connected to the Internet. If you need to use it, please go to the background of the client to unbundle the device certificate first, and then activate it through online activation. However, the previously generated certificate will not be withdrawn, i.e. the number of activations will not be restored.
