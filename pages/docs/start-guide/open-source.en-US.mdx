# Open Source & Commercialization
We think open source is a very cool thing, and it is very meaningful to be able to make a tool that can benefit more people.
The author of Chat2DB is also the author of Easyexcel.
Easyexcel is a very popular open source project.
We have maintained it for 7 years and has more than 30k stars on Github.
We also hope that Chat2DB can also become a popular open source project.
In the one year since Chat2DB was open sourced, we have been on Github's popular project list many times.
We have also received a lot of feedback from users, as well as contributions and support from users. We are very grateful for everyone's contribution, and we will Continued efforts will make Chat2DB a better tool to serve everyone.

At the same time, if we want a product to continue to develop and iterate, we need more resource support and a team that can maintain it continuously.
It is difficult to do this without a commercial model. We have seen many famous open source projects, such as: Cglib may be used by many people, but did you know that it is no longer maintained?
We don't want Chat2DB to become such a project. We hope that Chat2DB can continue to develop, continue to iterate, and continue to serve everyone.
So we decided to launch a commercial version, and we will provide more functions, better services, and better support. The open source version and the commercial version complement each other.
With more open source users, there will also be more commercial users, so that we can continue to develop. With commercial users, we can better support open source.

You may be worried that you will give up the open source version?
We promise that we will continue to maintain the open source version, update the open source version, and optimize the open source version.
Friends who want to participate in open source can submit a PR through Github https://github.com/chat2db/chat2db or contact us at Chat2DB@ch2db.com.
We will give certain rewards to contributors.
