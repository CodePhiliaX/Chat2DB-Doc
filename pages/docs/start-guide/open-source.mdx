# Open Source & Commercialization

We firmly believe in the power of open source and the endless possibilities it brings. Through open source, we can work together to create valuable tools that benefit the global community. The author of Chat2DB is also the author of EasyExcel, a very popular open source project that we have maintained for 7 years. Github has more than 30k stars, which fully demonstrates our commitment to the open source spirit and our focus on user needs.
In the year since Chat2DB was open sourced, we have been on the GitHub hot project list many times and received a lot of valuable feedback and support from users. Here, we sincerely thank every contributor and supporter for their active participation. We will continue to work hard to improve the functionality and performance of Chat2DB to ensure that it becomes an excellent data management tool to better serve the vast user community.

At the same time, if we want to keep a product evolving and iterating, we need more resource support and a team that can maintain it continuously. It is difficult to do this without a commercial model. We have seen many well-known open source projects, such as: Cglib may be used by many people, but did you know that it is no longer maintained? We don't want Chat2DB to become such a project. We hope that Chat2DB can continue to develop, continue to iterate, and continue to serve everyone. So we decided to launch a commercial version, and we will provide more features, better services, and better support. The open source version and the commercial version complement each other. With more open source users, there will be more commercial users, so that we can continue to develop. With commercial users, we can better feed back to the open source.

You may worry: Will you give up the open source version? We understand that some users may have concerns about the support of the open source version. Here, we solemnly promise: We will unswervingly maintain, update and optimize the open source version of Chat2DB. We firmly believe in the power of the open source community and will continue to invest resources to ensure the long-term development and stable operation of the open source version.
