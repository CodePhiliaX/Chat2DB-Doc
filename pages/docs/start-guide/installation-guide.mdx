# Installation Guide

We strongly recommend that you close all open applications. This will help ensure a smooth installation.

Chat2DB supports the following operating systems:

- Windows: Windows x64.

- MacOS: macOS Intel/Apple M chips.

- Linux: packaged as .AppImage, supports x86_64 and arm64.

## Windows

1. Download the `.exe` installer for the Windows version of Chat2DB.

2. Double-click the `.exe` file to start the installation wizard.

3. Follow the prompts of the installation wizard to complete the installation process.

## MacOS

1. Download the Chat2DB macOS version.

2. Open the `.dmg` file.

3. Drag Chat2DB to your Applications folder to install.

## Linux

1. Click the corresponding download link (`.ApplImage x86` or `.ApplImage arm64`) to download the application file.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded application file in the terminal.

3. Add execution permissions to the application file:

```bash
chmod +x <downloaded_file>
```
Where `<downloaded_file>` is the application file name you downloaded (e.g. `chat2db-linux-x86.applimage`).

4. Run the application:

```bash
./<downloaded_file>
```

The application should now be runnable. Please make sure that your Linux distribution allows installation of applications from non-standard repositories, or you may need to adjust security settings to allow such applications to run.

## Automatic Updates

This feature is only available on `Windows` and `macOS`.

Chat2DB automatically checks for new versions at regular intervals. If the check is not disabled and a new version is available, you will be prompted to decide whether to upgrade. If you choose to upgrade, the installer will automatically download and start after completion.

By default, Chat2DB is configured to automatically check for updates and notify you when a new version is available.

Updates are usually patch-based: they are applied to existing installations and only require you to restart the app.

However, sometimes patch updates are not available and a new version of Chat2DB must be installed from the [official website](https://chat2db-ai.com/download).

If Chat2DB does not have HTTP access outside of the local network, it will not be able to check for updates and apply patches.

In this case, you must download new versions of Chat2DB and install them manually.

> Note: Chat2DB itself shuts down gracefully to avoid data loss.
