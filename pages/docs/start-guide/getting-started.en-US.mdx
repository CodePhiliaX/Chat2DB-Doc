# Quick Start

## üìñ Introduction

Chat2DB is an AI first data management, development, and analysis tool. Its core is AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generation Code) capability. It can convert natural language into SQL, convert SQL into natural language, and can also automatically generate Reports greatly improve personnel efficiency. Through one product, the capabilities of data management, data development, and data analysis can be realized. Even those who do not understand SQL can use the ability to quickly query business data and generate reports.

## üöÄ Quick Start

This quick start guide will introduce you to the key concepts and help you with your first steps in Chat2DB.

Our products provide two ways of use: web page and client. The web page can be used out of the box, and the client provides a smoother user experience. At the same time, when some private databases or local data cannot be accessed from the public network, the client can connect to your database locally and use it directly without the need for a proxy. It is simple and convenient, and you can flexibly switch between using the web page or the client according to your scenario.
Below we explain how to use our products.

## Step 3: Create a database connection

Database connection is the first step for us to use Chat2DB. We need to connect to your database to perform subsequent operations. Click the database connection on the left, then click New Connection in the lower left corner, select the database you use, fill in the database connection information, and click Save. Currently we support Mysql, Postgresql, SQLServer, DB2, Oracle, SQLServer, Oceanbase, Clickhouse, Redis, H2, SQLite, Dameng, Renmin University of Finance and many other databases.
### 1. Create a new connection
!['newConnection-connection'](/image/connection/newConnection.png)

Click the Database button on the left, select New Connection, select the database type you need, fill in the database connection information, and click Save.

### 2. Fill in the database connection information

!['newConnection-connection'](/image/connection/connectioninfo.png)

- `Name`: The connection name can be customized to facilitate memory.
- `Env`: Select the connection environment, testing, production, etc. to distinguish connections in different environments
- `Host`: Mysql server address, which can be IP or domain name
- `Port`: Mysql server port, default 3306
- `Authentication`: Mysql authentication method, username and password or no authentication required
- `User`: Mysql username
- `Password`: Mysql password
- `Database`: Mysql database name, optional, if not filled in, it will connect to the default database
- `URL`: Mysql connection URL, optional, if not filled in, it will be automatically generated based on the above information
- `Driver`: Mysql driver, optional. If not filled in, it will be automatically identified based on the URL. You can also select it manually. After manual selection, the driver configuration items will be displayed.
- `SSH`: Whether to use SSH connection, optional. If not filled in, it will be disabled by default. SSH configuration items will be displayed after selection.
- `Advanced Configuration`: Advanced configuration, optional, not used by default if not filled in, advanced configuration items will be displayed after selection

Different databases on the client need to download different drivers. If you need SSH connection, you need to fill in the SSH information.


## Step 4: Test connection

!['ssh'](/image/connection/test.png)

Click the test button in the lower left corner to test whether the connection is normal. If the connection is normal, the connection will be successful. Otherwise, the connection will be failed. You can adjust the connection information according to the error message. Finally click Save.

## Step 5: Set Up AI data collection

After creating the link, a pop-up window will ask if you want to set up AI data collection now. 

Setting up AI data collection can better help the AI understand your database table structure, generating more accurate answers. This is also one of the major highlights of Chat2DB.

Click **'affirm'** to start the setup.

![aidata](/image/start-guide/aidata1.png)

1. Select the database for which you need to create the AI data collection in the upper right corner. 

2. Check the database tables you need to sync on the left side. 

3. Click 'Sync to AI data collection' to complete the creation.

## Step 6: Use Chat2DB database development

After the connection is successful, you can double-click the connection or right-click to enter the connection. Then you can add, delete, modify, and query the database in Chat2DB. You can also use our AIGC capability to directly query the database using natural language, or use SQL to convert to natural language.

### Database management
Double-click the newly created connection to enter the database management interface, where you can add, delete, modify, and query the database.
