# What is Surrogate Key?

## Introduction

A **surrogate key** is a unique identifier for records in a database table, which is not derived from application data, unlike a natural key. The primary purpose of using surrogate keys is to uniquely identify each record in the table without relying on the business logic or data that might change over time. Surrogate keys are often implemented as an auto-incrementing integer column or a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). They play a significant role in maintaining referential integrity and simplifying joins between tables in relational databases such as [MySQL](https://chat2db.ai/client/mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://chat2db.ai/client/postgresql), [Oracle](https://chat2db.ai/client/oracle), and [SQL Server](https://chat2db.ai/client/sqlserver).

Surrogate keys have become a popular choice among developers because they offer several advantages over natural keys, including improved performance and flexibility. However, it's important to understand their proper use and implications.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Surrogate Keys

### Detailed Explanation of Advantages

#### Data Stability

Since surrogate keys are independent of the business logic, they do not change when the business data changes. This stability ensures that relationships between tables remain intact even if there are updates to the data.

#### Simplified Joins

Using surrogate keys can simplify the process of joining tables, especially in complex database designs with multiple levels of relationships. The simplicity comes from having a consistent and reliable identifier across related tables.

#### Improved Performance

In many cases, surrogate keys can improve query performance because they tend to be smaller and more efficient than compound or composite keys. Smaller keys mean less storage space and faster index lookups.

#### Easier Data Maintenance

When data needs to be updated or corrected, surrogate keys make it easier to maintain relationships without affecting other parts of the database. For example, changing a customer's name does not require updating foreign keys in related tables.

### Detailed Explanation of Disadvantages

#### Additional Storage Requirements

Although surrogate keys are typically small integers, they do add extra columns to your tables, which increases the overall storage requirements.

#### Extra Indexes

To ensure uniqueness and facilitate fast lookups, surrogate keys usually require indexes, which can slow down insert operations due to the need to update the index.

#### Potential for Misuse

There is a risk that developers may overuse surrogate keys or apply them inappropriately, leading to unnecessary complexity in the database design.

## Implementation Examples

Below are some examples of how surrogate keys can be implemented in different database systems:

### MySQL Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### PostgreSQL Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### Oracle Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR2(50),
  last_name VARCHAR2(50),
  email VARCHAR2(100)
);
```

### SQL Server Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name NVARCHAR(50),
  last_name NVARCHAR(50),
  email NVARCHAR(100)
);
```

### SQLite Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  email TEXT
);
```

## Best Practices for Using Surrogate Keys

### Choose the Right Type

Decide whether to use an integer type or a GUID based on the specific requirements of your application. Integers are generally faster but may not be suitable for distributed systems where GUIDs can provide better scalability.

### Consider Business Rules

While surrogate keys abstract away from business rules, it's still essential to consider how they will interact with the business logic. Ensure that the introduction of surrogate keys does not complicate the application's data handling processes.

### Maintain Referential Integrity

Always set up appropriate foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity between tables. This practice prevents orphaned records and helps keep the database schema robust.

### Use Meaningful Names

Choose meaningful names for your surrogate key columns to make the database schema more understandable and maintainable. Avoid generic names like `id` unless it's clear within the context of the table.

## Comparison with Natural Keys

Natural keys are derived from the actual data and represent real-world entities, such as social security numbers or product codes. While they can be useful, they come with challenges like data volatility and potential duplication. Surrogate keys, on the other hand, offer a stable and predictable alternative that can enhance the performance and maintainability of a database.

## FAQ

1. **What is the difference between a surrogate key and a natural key?**
   - A surrogate key is an artificial identifier created specifically for database tables, while a natural key is derived from real-world data and represents the entity's inherent characteristics.

2. **Do surrogate keys always have to be integers?**
   - No, surrogate keys can also be implemented using other types like GUIDs. However, integers are common due to their efficiency in terms of storage and performance.

3. **Can surrogate keys lead to data redundancy?**
   - Surrogate keys themselves don't cause redundancy; however, improper use or lack of normalization can result in redundant data. It's crucial to design tables thoughtfully.

4. **How do surrogate keys impact database performance?**
   - Surrogate keys can improve performance by providing smaller, more efficient keys for indexing and joining. However, adding indexes for these keys can slow down write operations.

5. **Are surrogate keys necessary in every table?**
   - Not necessarily. Some tables might benefit more from natural keys or composite keys, depending on the nature of the data and the application's requirements.
