# What is an Incremental Backup

## Introduction to Incremental Backups

An **incremental backup** is a type of data backup method that only copies files that have changed since the last backup operation, which could be either a full backup or the most recent incremental or differential backup. This approach minimizes the amount of data that needs to be backed up each time, reducing storage space and backup time compared to full backups.

### Key Characteristics

- **Efficiency:** Only backs up files that have been modified since the last backup.
- **Space-Saving:** Requires less storage space than full backups because it does not duplicate unchanged data.
- **Time-Saving:** Shorter backup times because fewer files are processed.
- **Dependence on Previous Backups:** Relies on previous backups to restore data fully, making it part of a chain of backups.

## How Incremental Backups Work

Incremental backups operate by tracking changes made to files since the last backup. When a file is modified, created, or deleted, the backup system marks it as needing to be included in the next incremental backup. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Initial Full Backup:** A complete copy of all selected data is taken at the start.
2. **Subsequent Incremental Backups:** Only the files that have changed since the last backup (either full or incremental) are backed up.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you have a database server that requires regular backups. You decide to implement an incremental backup strategy as follows:

#### Day 1: Full Backup

- Perform a full backup of all the data on the server.

#### Days 2-7: Incremental Backups

- Each day, perform an incremental backup that captures only the changes made since the previous backup.

### Benefits of Incremental Backups

- **Reduced Storage Requirements:** Because only changed data is backed up, the total storage needed for backups is significantly reduced.
- **Faster Backup Operations:** Incremental backups typically take less time to complete than full backups.
- **Network Efficiency:** If backing up over a network, incremental backups reduce the bandwidth required.

### Challenges of Incremental Backups

- **Complexity in Restoration:** Restoring from incremental backups can be more complex because it requires accessing multiple backup sets to reconstruct the original data.
- **Backup Chain Dependency:** Since each incremental backup depends on the previous ones, losing one backup in the chain can make subsequent backups useless.
- **Maintenance of Backup Integrity:** Ensuring the integrity of the entire backup chain is crucial for successful restoration.

## Comparison with Other Backup Types

### Full Backup

- **Definition:** Copies all data every time without considering previous backups.
- **Pros:** Simple to restore; no dependency on previous backups.
- **Cons:** Requires more storage and takes longer to complete.

### Differential Backup

- **Definition:** Backs up all changes since the last full backup.
- **Pros:** Faster to restore than incremental backups because it only requires the last full backup and the most recent differential backup.
- **Cons:** Takes more space and time than incremental backups but less than full backups.

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing an incremental backup strategy, several factors should be considered:

- **Backup Software:** Choose software that supports incremental backups and integrates well with your existing systems.
- **Backup Schedule:** Develop a schedule that balances the frequency of full and incremental backups based on data change rates and recovery objectives.
- **Storage Management:** Plan for adequate storage capacity and management of backup files.
- **Testing:** Regularly test your backup and restore procedures to ensure they work as expected.
- **Documentation:** Keep detailed documentation of your backup processes and any dependencies between backups.

## Best Practices for Incremental Backups

- **Regular Full Backups:** Even when using incremental backups, performing periodic full backups can simplify recovery and reduce the risk associated with long chains of incremental backups.
- **Data Change Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to track how much data changes over time, helping to optimize backup schedules.
- **Security Measures:** Ensure that backup data is protected through encryption and secure storage practices.
- **Automation:** Automate the backup process to reduce manual errors and ensure consistency.
- **Verification:** Verify the integrity of backup files regularly to ensure they can be used for recovery.

## Conclusion

Incremental backups provide an efficient way to protect data by minimizing storage requirements and backup times. By understanding how incremental backups work and their advantages and challenges, organizations can implement effective data protection strategies that balance performance, storage costs, and recovery capabilities. Proper planning and best practices ensure that incremental backups contribute to robust disaster recovery plans.
