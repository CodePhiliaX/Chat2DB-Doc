# What is a Deadlock

## Introduction to Deadlocks

A **deadlock** is a situation in which two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of the others to release a resource. In the context of databases, deadlocks occur when two or more transactions are waiting on each other to release locks they hold on database resources (like tables or rows), thus creating a circular dependency that cannot be resolved without external intervention.

Deadlocks can lead to significant issues in database management systems (DBMS) and application performance, as they cause transactions to hang indefinitely until the deadlock is detected and resolved by the system. This can result in delayed operations, reduced throughput, and potentially lost work if transactions need to be rolled back.

### Key Characteristics

- **Circular Wait:** Each process in the deadlock set is waiting for a resource that is held by another process in the set.
- **Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode, meaning only one process can use the resource at any given time.
- **Hold and Wait:** A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently held by other processes.
- **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; they can only be released voluntarily.

## Causes of Deadlocks

Deadlocks typically arise due to poor transaction design, improper locking strategies, or concurrent access patterns that lead to conflicting lock requests. Common causes include:

- **Lock Escalation:** When a transaction escalates its lock level (e.g., from row-level to table-level locks) while holding locks on multiple resources.
- **Inconsistent Locking Order:** If different transactions acquire locks on the same resources but in different orders, it can create conditions where neither can proceed.
- **Long Transactions:** Long-running transactions increase the likelihood of conflicts with other transactions trying to access the same data.
- **Nested Transactions:** Complex nested transactions can inadvertently create cycles of dependencies.

## Deadlock Prevention Strategies

To prevent deadlocks, DBMSs and applications can adopt various strategies:

- **Preventing Circular Wait:** Ensure that all transactions follow a predefined order when acquiring locks on resources. This eliminates the possibility of circular waits.
- **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for lock acquisition attempts, so a transaction does not wait indefinitely.
- **Wait-Die Scheme:** Older transactions may kill younger ones to resolve contention, or vice versa, depending on the scheme.
- **Wound-Wait Scheme:** An older transaction forces a younger one to wait, avoiding potential deadlocks.

## Deadlock Detection and Recovery

When prevention methods fail, detecting and recovering from deadlocks becomes necessary. Most modern DBMSs have built-in mechanisms for automatic deadlock detection and resolution:

- **Detection Algorithms:** Use algorithms like the cycle detection algorithm on a resource allocation graph to identify deadlocks.
- **Rollback:** Once a deadlock is detected, the system selects one or more "victim" transactions to roll back, releasing their locks and allowing other transactions to proceed. The selection of victims can be based on factors like transaction age, cost, or priority.
- **Logging and Alerts:** Keep logs of deadlock occurrences and provide alerts to administrators for further analysis and tuning.

## Practical Example

### Banking Application Scenario

Consider a banking application where two transactions, `T1` and `T2`, are transferring money between accounts `A` and `B`.

#### Step 1: Initial Locks

- `T1` acquires an exclusive lock on account `A`.
- `T2` acquires an exclusive lock on account `B`.

#### Step 2: Conflict Arises

- `T1` tries to acquire a lock on account `B` but must wait because `T2` already holds a lock on it.
- `T2` tries to acquire a lock on account `A` but must wait because `T1` already holds a lock on it.

#### Result: Deadlock

At this point, both transactions are waiting for each other to release their locks, resulting in a deadlock.

#### Resolution

The DBMS detects the deadlock using its monitoring mechanisms and decides to roll back one of the transactions (say, `T2`). After rolling back `T2`, it releases its lock on account `B`, allowing `T1` to proceed. `T2` can then be retried after `T1` completes.

## Conclusion

Deadlocks are a common challenge in multi-user database environments, especially those with high concurrency. Understanding how deadlocks occur and implementing effective prevention and recovery strategies is crucial for maintaining system stability and performance. By ensuring proper transaction design, adopting best practices for locking, and leveraging the built-in capabilities of DBMSs, developers and administrators can minimize the impact of deadlocks on their applications and databases.
