# What is a Materialized View?

## Introduction to Materialized Views

A **Materialized View** is a database object that contains the result set of a query. Unlike a standard view, which is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement and does not store data physically, a materialized view stores the result set as actual data in the database. This stored data can be queried just like a regular table, but it provides performance benefits for complex queries or large datasets because the results are precomputed and stored.

### Key Characteristics

- **Precomputed Results:** Stores the result of a query as physical data, allowing faster access compared to executing the query each time.
- **Refreshable:** Can be refreshed periodically or on demand to update the data with the latest information from the underlying tables.
- **Indexable:** Indexes can be created on materialized views to further enhance query performance.
- **Query Rewrite:** Some databases automatically rewrite queries to use materialized views when possible, improving performance without changing application code.

## Benefits of Using Materialized Views

- **Performance Optimization:** Reduces the execution time of complex queries by providing precomputed results.
- **Offloading Aggregations:** Moves the computational burden of aggregations and joins to the refresh process rather than at query time.
- **Data Replication:** Acts as a mechanism for replicating data between different databases or systems.
- **Data Archiving:** Useful for archiving historical data that doesn't change frequently but needs to be available for reporting.

## Types of Refresh Methods

Materialized views can be refreshed using different methods depending on the requirements and the database system:

### 1. Complete Refresh

- **Description:** Recreates the entire materialized view from scratch by re-executing the defining query.
- **Usage:** Suitable for small datasets or when changes in the underlying data are significant.
- **Characteristics:** Ensures the materialized view is up-to-date but can be resource-intensive.

#### Example Command (Oracle)

```sql
BEGIN
   DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('sales_mv', 'C');
END;
```

### 2. Fast Refresh

- **Description:** Applies only the changes made to the underlying tables since the last refresh.
- **Usage:** Efficient for large datasets where only a few records have changed.
- **Characteristics:** Requires logging or tracking mechanisms to capture changes; not all types of queries support fast refresh.

#### Example Command (Oracle)

```sql
BEGIN
   DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('sales_mv', 'F');
END;
```

### 3. On Demand Refresh

- **Description:** Refreshes the materialized view manually or via scheduled jobs.
- **Usage:** Provides flexibility in choosing when to update the materialized view.
- **Characteristics:** Can be used with both complete and fast refresh methods.

### 4. Automatic Refresh

- **Description:** Configured to refresh automatically at specified intervals or triggered by certain events.
- **Usage:** Ensures that the materialized view stays up-to-date without manual intervention.
- **Characteristics:** Ideal for scenarios requiring near-real-time data availability.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Storage Requirements:** Materialized views require additional storage space to keep the precomputed data.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Regularly refreshing materialized views can add to maintenance tasks and resource consumption.
- **Concurrency Control:** Managing concurrent updates and queries can be complex, especially during refresh operations.
- **Query Performance:** While materialized views improve read performance, they may introduce overhead for write operations due to the need for maintaining consistency.

## Common Use Cases

- **Reporting Systems:** Enhances the performance of reporting applications by precomputing aggregated data.
- **Data Warehousing:** Supports efficient querying of large datasets by summarizing data into more manageable chunks.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Facilitates analysis of historical data without impacting the performance of live transactions.
- **Cross-Database Queries:** Enables efficient querying across multiple databases by caching the results locally.

## Best Practices

- **Evaluate Refresh Strategy:** Choose the most appropriate refresh method based on data volatility and performance requirements.
- **Monitor Storage Usage:** Keep track of the storage consumed by materialized views to ensure it remains within acceptable limits.
- **Use Query Rewrite:** Take advantage of automatic query rewrite features provided by the database to leverage materialized views without altering existing queries.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure that the materialized view accurately reflects the current state of the underlying data by setting up proper refresh schedules.

## Conclusion

Materialized views offer a powerful way to optimize query performance and manage large datasets efficiently. By understanding their characteristics, benefits, and implementation considerations, database administrators and developers can utilize materialized views to enhance the performance and scalability of their applications. Whether it's speeding up complex reports or facilitating cross-database queries, materialized views provide valuable tools for managing and accessing data effectively.
