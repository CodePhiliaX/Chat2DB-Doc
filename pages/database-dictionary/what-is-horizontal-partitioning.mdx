# What is Horizontal Partitioning

## Introduction to Horizontal Partitioning

**Horizontal Partitioning**, also known as **row-based partitioning**, is a database design technique where a table is divided into multiple smaller, more manageable pieces called **partitions**. Each partition contains a subset of the rows from the original table based on specified criteria. This approach contrasts with **vertical partitioning**, which splits tables by columns.

### Key Characteristics

- **Row-Based:** Divides data into partitions based on row criteria.
- **Improved Performance:** Enhances query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.
- **Scalability:** Facilitates better scalability and management of large datasets.
- **Maintainability:** Simplifies maintenance tasks like backups, indexing, and archiving.

## How Horizontal Partitioning Works

Horizontal partitioning involves splitting a table into multiple partitions, each containing a subset of the table's rows. The division is typically based on:

- **Range Partitioning:** Rows are distributed based on a range of values in a specific column (e.g., date ranges).
- **List Partitioning:** Rows are grouped based on a list of discrete values (e.g., region codes).
- **Hash Partitioning:** A hash function is applied to one or more columns to determine the partition.
- **Round-Robin Partitioning:** Rows are evenly distributed across partitions without regard to any column value.

### Example: Horizontal Partitioning Process

Consider a `Sales` table that records sales transactions:

| sale_id | customer_id | sale_date   | product_id | quantity | price |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1       | 101         | 2024-01-01  | 501        | 2        | 100.00|
| 2       | 102         | 2024-01-02  | 502        | 3        | 150.00|
| 3       | 103         | 2024-02-01  | 501        | 1        | 100.00|
| 4       | 104         | 2024-02-15  | 503        | 5        | 250.00|

### Range Partitioning Example

Partition the `Sales` table based on `sale_date`:

#### Sales_Partition_2024_Q1

| sale_id | customer_id | sale_date   | product_id | quantity | price |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1       | 101         | 2024-01-01  | 501        | 2        | 100.00|
| 2       | 102         | 2024-01-02  | 502        | 3        | 150.00|

#### Sales_Partition_2024_Q2

| sale_id | customer_id | sale_date   | product_id | quantity | price |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| 3       | 103         | 2024-02-01  | 501        | 1        | 100.00|
| 4       | 104         | 2024-02-15  | 503        | 5        | 250.00|

### Hash Partitioning Example

Using a hash function on `customer_id`:

#### Sales_Partition_Hash1

| sale_id | customer_id | sale_date   | product_id | quantity | price |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| 1       | 101         | 2024-01-01  | 501        | 2        | 100.00|
| 4       | 104         | 2024-02-15  | 503        | 5        | 250.00|

#### Sales_Partition_Hash2

| sale_id | customer_id | sale_date   | product_id | quantity | price |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| 2       | 102         | 2024-01-02  | 502        | 3        | 150.00|
| 3       | 103         | 2024-02-01  | 501        | 1        | 100.00|

## Benefits of Horizontal Partitioning

- **Performance Optimization:** Queries that filter on partitioning keys can access only relevant partitions, reducing I/O and improving speed.
- **Scalability:** Easier to manage and scale large datasets by distributing them across multiple storage devices or servers.
- **Maintenance:** Simplifies tasks such as backup and recovery, as individual partitions can be managed independently.
- **Data Archiving:** Older data can be moved to less expensive storage or archived while keeping recent data online for quick access.
- **Load Balancing:** Helps distribute load evenly across multiple resources, improving overall system performance.

## Considerations

- **Partitioning Strategy:** Choosing the right partitioning key is crucial for optimal performance and maintainability.
- **Query Complexity:** Complex queries may need to access multiple partitions, potentially negating some performance benefits.
- **Storage Management:** Proper planning is required to ensure efficient use of storage resources.
- **Application Changes:** May require modifications to application logic to handle partitioned data correctly.

## Implementation in SQL

### Creating Partitions in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL supports table partitioning through inheritance or declarative partitioning starting from version 10.

#### Range Partitioning Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id int,
    customer_id int,
    sale_date date,
    product_id int,
    quantity int,
    price numeric
) PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date);

CREATE TABLE sales_q1 PARTITION OF sales
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-04-01');

CREATE TABLE sales_q2 PARTITION OF sales
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-04-01') TO ('2024-07-01');
```

### Creating Partitions in MySQL

MySQL supports partitioning starting from version 5.1.

#### Hash Partitioning Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id int,
    customer_id int,
    sale_date date,
    product_id int,
    quantity int,
    price numeric
)
PARTITION BY HASH(YEAR(sale_date))
PARTITIONS 4;
```

## Conclusion

Horizontal partitioning is a powerful technique for managing and optimizing large datasets in databases. By dividing tables into smaller, more manageable pieces, it enhances performance, scalability, and maintainability. Understanding how to implement and leverage horizontal partitioning can significantly benefit database administrators and developers working with large-scale applications.
