# What is Denormalization

## Introduction to Denormalization

**Denormalization** is a database optimization technique that involves adding redundant data to a database schema in order to improve read performance. It is the process of moving from higher normal forms to lower normal forms, or even unnormalized structures, to reduce the need for complex and costly join operations. While normalization aims to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity by organizing data into multiple tables with minimal repetition, denormalization intentionally introduces redundancy to enhance query performance.

### Key Characteristics

- **Increased Read Performance:** By reducing the number of joins required to retrieve related data, queries can execute faster.
- **Redundancy:** Data duplication occurs as related information is stored in multiple places within the database.
- **Trade-off:** Improved read speed often comes at the cost of more storage space and potentially slower write operations due to the need to update multiple copies of data.

## Reasons for Denormalization

Denormalization is typically applied in scenarios where:

- **High Read-to-Write Ratio:** Applications that have many more read operations than write operations can benefit from faster reads.
- **Complex Queries:** When queries involve multiple joins across several tables, denormalization can simplify these queries and improve their execution time.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Data warehouses and analytical systems often use denormalized schemas to facilitate efficient aggregation and reporting.
- **Read-Optimized Databases:** Certain databases are designed to optimize read performance, making them suitable candidates for denormalization.

## Techniques of Denormalization

### 1. **Adding Derived Columns**

Derived columns store precomputed values based on other columns, such as totals, averages, or concatenated strings. This reduces the need for calculations during query execution.

#### Example:
Instead of calculating the total sales for each product every time it's queried, you can store the total in a separate column.

```sql
-- Normalized approach
SELECT product_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;

-- Denormalized approach (with derived column)
SELECT product_id, total_sales
FROM products;
```

### 2. **Combining Tables**

Merging related tables into a single table can eliminate the need for joins. This is particularly useful when certain tables are frequently queried together.

#### Example:
Combining customer and order details into one table.

```sql
-- Normalized approach
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- Denormalized approach
SELECT customer_name, order_date, total_amount
FROM customer_orders;
```

### 3. **Storing Redundant Data**

Duplicating data from one table into another can speed up retrieval but requires careful management to maintain consistency.

#### Example:
Storing the city name in both the customers and addresses tables instead of just linking via an address ID.

```sql
-- Normalized approach
SELECT c.customer_name, a.city
FROM customers c
JOIN addresses a ON c.address_id = a.address_id;

-- Denormalized approach
SELECT customer_name, city
FROM customers;
```

### 4. **Using Materialized Views**

Materialized views store the result set of a query physically in the database, allowing for fast access without recalculating the view each time.

#### Example:
Creating a materialized view for frequently accessed aggregated data.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS
SELECT product_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date);
```

## Challenges and Considerations

While denormalization can significantly boost read performance, it also presents challenges:

- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring consistency between duplicated data requires additional logic during insert, update, and delete operations.
- **Storage Overhead:** Storing redundant data increases disk usage and can lead to larger backups and longer restore times.
- **Maintenance Complexity:** More complex schemas and business rules can make maintenance and troubleshooting harder.
- **Write Performance:** Updates to denormalized data may be slower because changes need to be propagated across multiple locations.

## Best Practices for Denormalization

- **Identify Critical Paths:** Focus denormalization efforts on areas of the application that have significant performance bottlenecks.
- **Use Caching Wisely:** Leverage caching mechanisms to further enhance read performance without fully denormalizing the schema.
- **Maintain ACID Compliance:** Ensure that transactions adhere to ACID properties to preserve data integrity.
- **Monitor Performance:** Continuously monitor the impact of denormalization on both read and write operations to strike the right balance.

## Conclusion

Denormalization is a powerful tool for optimizing database performance, especially in read-heavy applications and data warehousing environments. However, it should be applied judiciously, considering the trade-offs between performance gains and potential drawbacks like increased complexity and storage requirements. By carefully analyzing application needs and workload patterns, developers can effectively utilize denormalization to deliver better user experiences while maintaining robust data management practices.
