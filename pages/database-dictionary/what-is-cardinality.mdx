# What is Cardinality

## Introduction to Cardinality

**Cardinality** in the context of databases refers to the uniqueness of data values contained in a column (or attribute) of a database table. More specifically, it indicates the number of distinct values that can appear in a column or the relationship between two tables.

### Types of Cardinality

There are two main contexts where cardinality is used:

1. **Column Cardinality:** Refers to the uniqueness of data within a single column.
2. **Relationship Cardinality:** Describes the relationships between tables and the constraints on those relationships.

## Column Cardinality

### Definitions

- **High Cardinality:** A column with high cardinality has many unique values relative to the number of rows in the table. Examples include `email`, `SSN`, or `employee_id`.
- **Low Cardinality:** A column with low cardinality has few unique values compared to the number of rows. Examples include `gender`, `status`, or `department`.

### Importance

Understanding column cardinality is crucial for:

- **Indexing:** High-cardinality columns are often good candidates for indexing because they can efficiently narrow down search results.
- **Query Optimization:** Database query optimizers use cardinality estimates to choose the most efficient execution plans.

## Relationship Cardinality

### Definitions

Relationship cardinality describes how records in one table relate to records in another. The main types are:

- **One-to-One (1:1):** Each record in Table A relates to exactly one record in Table B, and vice versa.
  - Example: A person has exactly one passport, and each passport belongs to exactly one person.
  
- **One-to-Many (1:N):** One record in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B, but each record in Table B relates to only one record in Table A.
  - Example: One department can have many employees, but each employee belongs to only one department.
  
- **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Multiple records in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B, and vice versa.
  - Example: Students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

### Diagram Representation

In Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, cardinality is represented using symbols next to the lines connecting entities:

- **1:1:** A single line with a small perpendicular line at both ends.
- **1:N:** A single line with a crow's foot symbol at the "many" end.
- **M:N:** Both ends have crow's foot symbols, often requiring a junction table to represent the relationship.

## Practical Example

### ER Diagram Example

Consider an ER diagram for a university database:

- **Student** entity:
  - Attributes: `student_id`, `name`, `major`
- **Course** entity:
  - Attributes: `course_id`, `title`, `credits`

The relationship between students and courses is many-to-many (`M:N`), as each student can take multiple courses, and each course can be taken by multiple students. This relationship requires a junction table called `enrollment`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    major VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    credits INT
);

CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    grade CHAR(2),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Student(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Course(course_id)
);
```

## Conclusion

Understanding cardinality—both in terms of column uniqueness and table relationships—is fundamental to designing efficient and well-structured databases. Properly managing cardinality ensures data integrity and supports optimal query performance.
