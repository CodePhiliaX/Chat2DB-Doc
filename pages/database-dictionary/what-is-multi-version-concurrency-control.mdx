# What is Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)?

## Introduction to MVCC

**Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** is a concurrency control method used in database management systems to provide concurrent access to the database and maintain data consistency. It allows multiple transactions to occur simultaneously without interfering with each other, ensuring that each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database at a specific point in time. MVCC achieves this by maintaining multiple versions of data records, enabling read operations to proceed without being blocked by write operations and vice versa.

### Key Characteristics

- **Non-blocking Reads:** Readers do not block writers, and writers do not block readers.
- **Consistent Snapshots:** Each transaction operates on a consistent snapshot of the database, preventing dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
- **Versioning:** Maintains multiple versions of data rows to support concurrent transactions.
- **Isolation Levels:** Supports various isolation levels like Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable, depending on the implementation.

## How MVCC Works

MVCC works by keeping track of different versions of data rows within the database. When a transaction starts, it creates a snapshot of the database based on the state of the data at that moment. Subsequent read operations within the transaction will use this snapshot, ensuring they see a consistent view of the data regardless of changes made by other transactions.

### Versioning Mechanism

- **Row Versions:** For each row updated or inserted, the database system maintains a version history. This includes:
  - **Transaction ID (XID):** A unique identifier for each transaction.
  - **Start Timestamp:** The time when the transaction started.
  - **End Timestamp:** The time when the transaction ended.
- **Visibility Rules:** Transactions determine which version of a row to read based on visibility rules. A row version is visible if its creation transaction has committed and its deletion transaction (if any) has not yet committed.

#### Example Visibility Rules

- **Read Committed Isolation Level:** A row version is visible if its creating transaction has committed before the current transaction's start timestamp.
- **Repeatable Read Isolation Level:** Once a transaction reads a row version, it remains visible throughout the transaction's lifetime, even if the row is modified by another transaction.
- **Serializable Isolation Level:** Ensures strict isolation, preventing phantom reads by locking ranges of keys or using more sophisticated mechanisms.

### Write Operations

When a transaction modifies a row, instead of overwriting the existing data, a new version of the row is created. This process is often referred to as "write-ahead logging" or "shadow paging," depending on the implementation. The old version remains available for ongoing transactions that require a consistent snapshot.

### Garbage Collection

As older versions of rows become obsolete (i.e., no longer needed by any active transaction), the database system performs garbage collection to reclaim storage space. This can be done through background processes or during routine maintenance tasks.

## Benefits of MVCC

- **Improved Concurrency:** Allows multiple users to read and write data concurrently without blocking each other.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Reduces contention between transactions, leading to better overall performance.
- **Consistent Views:** Provides each transaction with a consistent view of the database, avoiding anomalies like dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
- **Simplified Application Logic:** Applications do not need to handle complex locking mechanisms, as MVCC manages concurrency transparently.

## Implementation Examples

Different database systems implement MVCC with varying degrees of complexity and features:

### PostgreSQL

- **Visibility Map:** Tracks pages that contain only visible tuples, optimizing queries.
- **HOT (Heap-Only Tuples) Updates:** Minimizes bloat by allowing updates to rows without changing their index entries.

### Oracle Database

- **Undo Segments:** Store old versions of rows, enabling consistent reads across transactions.
- **SCNs (System Change Numbers):** Provide timestamps for transactions, helping to establish visibility rules.

### MySQL InnoDB

- **Rollback Segments:** Keep historical versions of rows for consistent reads.
- **Next-Key Locks:** Combine record locks with gap locks to prevent phantom reads under certain isolation levels.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Storage Overhead:** Maintaining multiple versions of data can lead to increased storage requirements.
- **Garbage Collection Complexity:** Efficiently reclaiming storage from obsolete row versions can be challenging.
- **Complexity in Implementation:** Designing and implementing an effective MVCC mechanism can be technically complex.

## Conclusion

Multi-Version Concurrency Control is a powerful technique for managing concurrent access to databases while maintaining data consistency. By allowing multiple versions of data to coexist, MVCC provides non-blocking reads and writes, improving performance and simplifying application logic. Understanding how MVCC works and its benefits and challenges is crucial for developers and database administrators working with modern database systems.
