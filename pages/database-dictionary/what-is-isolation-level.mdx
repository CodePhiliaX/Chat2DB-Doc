# What is an Isolation Level

## Introduction to Isolation Levels

An **isolation level** in database systems defines how transaction integrity is visible to other users and transactions. It determines the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from resource modifications made by other concurrent transactions. Isolation levels are crucial for ensuring data consistency and preventing issues such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

### Key Characteristics

- **Transaction Isolation:** Ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Data Consistency:** Helps maintain consistent views of data across multiple transactions.
- **Concurrency Control:** Balances between isolation and performance by allowing different degrees of access to shared resources.

## Standard Isolation Levels

The SQL standard defines four isolation levels, listed from least restrictive to most restrictive:

1. **Read Uncommitted**
2. **Read Committed**
3. **Repeatable Read**
4. **Serializable**

Each level addresses specific types of problems that can occur due to concurrent transactions.

### 1. Read Uncommitted

- **Description:** The lowest isolation level where transactions can read uncommitted changes (dirty reads) made by other transactions.
- **Problems Addressed:** None
- **Issues Possible:** Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads
- **Use Case:** Rarely used because it allows reading uncommitted data, which can lead to inconsistent results.

#### Example Scenario:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
```

### 2. Read Committed

- **Description:** Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads. A transaction can only read committed data.
- **Problems Addressed:** Dirty Reads
- **Issues Possible:** Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads
- **Use Case:** Commonly used in many applications because it prevents reading uncommitted data while still allowing a high degree of concurrency.

#### Example Scenario:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

### 3. Repeatable Read

- **Description:** Ensures that if a transaction reads the same data multiple times, it will get the same result every time. It prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads.
- **Problems Addressed:** Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads
- **Issues Possible:** Phantom Reads
- **Use Case:** Useful when you need to ensure that within a transaction, the data you read does not change until the transaction ends.

#### Example Scenario:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
```

### 4. Serializable

- **Description:** The highest isolation level, which ensures complete isolation. Transactions are completely isolated from one another, preventing all types of concurrent read issues.
- **Problems Addressed:** Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads
- **Issues Possible:** None
- **Use Case:** Used when absolute consistency is required, but it can significantly reduce concurrency and may lead to lower performance.

#### Example Scenario:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

## Problems Addressed by Different Isolation Levels

- **Dirty Reads:** Occur when a transaction reads data that has been modified but not yet committed by another transaction.
- **Non-repeatable Reads:** Happen when a transaction reads the same row multiple times and gets different results because another transaction has modified or deleted the row.
- **Phantom Reads:** Occur when a transaction re-executes a query and finds new rows that match the search condition because another transaction has inserted or updated rows.

## Benefits of Using Isolation Levels

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that transactions operate on consistent and accurate data.
- **Concurrency Control:** Balances the trade-off between isolation and performance by allowing different degrees of access to shared resources.
- **Application Stability:** Helps prevent anomalies that could lead to application instability or incorrect behavior.

## Considerations

- **Performance Impact:** Higher isolation levels provide greater protection against concurrency issues but can reduce system throughput and increase contention.
- **Locking Mechanisms:** Different isolation levels use various locking mechanisms, which can affect performance and scalability.
- **Application Requirements:** Choose the appropriate isolation level based on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.

## Implementation in Different SQL Databases

### Oracle Database

Oracle uses a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) model and defaults to `READ COMMITTED`. It does not support `READ UNCOMMITTED` and `SERIALIZABLE` is implemented differently compared to the SQL standard.

#### Setting Isolation Level:
```sql
ALTER SESSION SET ISOLATION_LEVEL = SERIALIZABLE;
```

### MySQL Database

MySQL supports all four standard isolation levels. The default isolation level is `REPEATABLE READ`.

#### Setting Isolation Level:
```sql
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

### PostgreSQL Database

PostgreSQL also supports all four standard isolation levels. The default isolation level is `READ COMMITTED`.

#### Setting Isolation Level:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

SQL Server supports all four standard isolation levels. The default isolation level is `READ COMMITTED`.

#### Setting Isolation Level:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
```

## Conclusion

Isolation levels play a critical role in maintaining data consistency and integrity in concurrent transaction environments. By understanding the different isolation levels and their effects, database administrators and developers can choose the right level of isolation for their applications, balancing between data accuracy and system performance. Proper configuration of isolation levels leads to reliable and efficient database operations.
