# What is a Dirty Read

## Introduction to Dirty Reads

A **Dirty Read** occurs in database systems when a transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction but not yet committed. This means the reading transaction sees uncommitted changes, which may be rolled back later. As a result, the reading transaction might base its operations on data that eventually does not become part of the permanent database state.

### Key Characteristics

- **Uncommitted Data:** The read operation accesses data that is still part of an ongoing transaction and has not been finalized.
- **Potential Inconsistency:** If the writing transaction rolls back, the read data becomes inconsistent with the final state of the database.
- **Non-Repeatability:** Subsequent reads of the same data within the same transaction can yield different results if the writing transaction commits or rolls back.

## Impact of Dirty Reads

Dirty reads can lead to several issues:

- **Data Inconsistency:** Applications may operate on incorrect or transient data, leading to erroneous conclusions or actions.
- **Application Logic Errors:** Business processes relying on accurate data can fail or produce wrong outputs.
- **Transaction Integrity:** The overall integrity of transactions can be compromised, affecting the reliability of the database system.

## Isolation Levels and Dirty Reads

Database management systems (DBMS) provide different isolation levels to control how transactions interact with each other. The lowest isolation level, **Read Uncommitted**, allows dirty reads, while higher isolation levels prevent them:

- **Read Uncommitted:** Allows dirty reads; no protection against uncommitted changes.
- **Read Committed:** Prevents dirty reads by ensuring that only committed data can be read.
- **Repeatable Read:** Ensures that once a row is read, it cannot be changed until the transaction completes.
- **Serializable:** Provides the highest level of isolation, preventing all forms of concurrent transaction interference.

### Example Scenario

Consider two transactions, `T1` and `T2`, interacting with a banking application:

#### Step 1: Initial State

- Account balance for user `Alice` is $1000.

#### Step 2: Transaction `T1` Starts

- `T1` begins and attempts to withdraw $500 from Alice's account.
- The new balance after withdrawal would be $500, but `T1` has not committed this change yet.

#### Step 3: Transaction `T2` Reads Uncommitted Data

- `T2` starts and performs a dirty read, seeing the uncommitted balance of $500.

#### Step 4: Transaction `T1` Rolls Back

- `T1` encounters an error and rolls back, restoring the original balance of $1000.

#### Result: Inconsistent Data

- `T2` now holds an outdated and incorrect view of Alice's account balance ($500), which could lead to incorrect decisions or actions based on this faulty information.

## Prevention of Dirty Reads

To prevent dirty reads, DBMSs implement various locking mechanisms and concurrency control protocols:

- **Locking:** Acquire locks on rows or pages being read to prevent other transactions from modifying them until the current transaction completes.
- **Versioning:** Use multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to maintain multiple versions of data, allowing readers to see committed snapshots without blocking writers.
- **Isolation Levels:** Set appropriate isolation levels to enforce stricter rules about what data can be read during transactions.

### Best Practices

- **Choose Appropriate Isolation Level:** Select the isolation level that balances performance and data consistency requirements.
- **Minimize Long Transactions:** Keep transactions short to reduce contention and the likelihood of dirty reads.
- **Use Optimistic Concurrency Control:** Allow transactions to proceed without locking and resolve conflicts at commit time.
- **Monitor and Tune:** Regularly review query patterns and adjust isolation settings as needed to optimize performance and ensure data integrity.

## Conclusion

Dirty reads represent a significant challenge in maintaining data consistency and integrity within concurrent database environments. By understanding the implications of dirty reads and adopting best practices for isolation levels and concurrency control, developers and database administrators can mitigate risks and ensure reliable database operations. Choosing the right isolation level and implementing effective locking strategies are critical steps in preventing dirty reads and preserving the accuracy of data accessed by applications.
